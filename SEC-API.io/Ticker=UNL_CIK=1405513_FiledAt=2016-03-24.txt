What is UNL? 

&#160;

The United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP (&#8220;UNL&#8221;) is a Delaware limited partnership organized on June 27, 2007. UNL maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612. UNL is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership interests (&#8220;shares&#8221;) traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the &#8220;NYSE Arca&#8221;). It operates pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of March 1, 2013 (as amended from time to time, the &#8220;LP Agreement&#8221;), which grants full management control to its general partner, United States Commodity Funds LLC (&#8220;USCF&#8221;).

&#160;

The investment objective of UNL is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares&#8217; per share net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the daily changes in the average of the prices of 12 futures contracts on natural gas traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the &#8220;NYMEX&#8221;), consisting of the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 months, for a total of 12 consecutive months&#8217; contracts, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 consecutive months (the &#8220;Benchmark Futures Contracts&#8221;), less UNL&#8217;s expenses. When calculating the daily movement of the average price of the 12 contracts, each contract month is equally weighted. It is not the intent of UNL to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of natural gas or any particular futures contract based on natural gas. It is not the intent of UNL to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments (as defined below). UNL&#8217;s shares began trading on November 18, 2009. USCF is the general partner of UNL and is responsible for the management of UNL.

&#160; 

Who is USCF? 

&#160;

USCF is a single member limited liability company that was formed in the state of Delaware on May 10, 2005. USCF maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612. USCF is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wainwright Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Wainwright&#8221;). Mr. Nicholas Gerber (discussed below) controls Wainwright by virtue of his ownership or control of a majority of Wainwright&#8217;s shares. Wainwright is a holding company that currently holds shares of both USCF, as well as USCF Advisers LLC, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. USCF Advisers LLC serves as the investment adviser for the Stock Split Index Fund, a series of the USCF ETF Trust. USCF ETF Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). The Board of Trustees for the USCF ETF Trust consists of different independent trustees than those independent directors who serve on the Board of Directors of USCF. USCF is a member of the National Futures Association (the &#8220;NFA&#8221;) and registered as a commodity pool operator (&#8220;CPO&#8221;) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#8220;CFTC&#8221;) on December 1, 2005 and as a Swaps Firm on August 8, 2013.

&#160;

USCF also serves as general partner or sponsor of the United States Oil Fund, LP (&#8220;USO&#8221;), the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (&#8220;UNG&#8221;), the United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP (&#8220;USL&#8221;), the United States Gasoline Fund, LP (&#8220;UGA&#8221;), the United States Diesel-Heating Oil Fund, LP (&#8220;UHN&#8221;), the United States Short Oil Fund, LP (&#8220;DNO&#8221;), the United States Brent Oil Fund, LP (&#8220;BNO&#8221;), the United States Commodity Index Fund (&#8220;USCI&#8221;), the United States Copper Index Fund (&#8220;CPER&#8221;) and the United States Agriculture Index Fund (&#8220;USAG&#8221;). USO, UNG, USL, UGA, UHN, DNO, BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG are actively operating funds and all are listed on the NYSE Arca, and referred to collectively herein as the &#8220;Related Public Funds.&#8221; The Related Public Funds are subject to reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). For more information about each of the Related Public Funds, investors in UNL may call 1.800.920.0259 or visit www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) website at www.sec.gov.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On January 30, 2015, USCF as the sponsor of United States Commodity Index Funds Trust (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) and its series the United States Metals Index Fund (&#8216;USMI&#8221;) announced that its officers and the sole member had authorized a plan to (i) liquidate USMI, (ii) terminate the continuous offering of USMI, and (iii) deregister USMI under the Exchange Act, and therefore, terminate the Trust&#8217;s obligation to include USMI on its periodic and current reports with the SEC. USCF has submitted written notice to the NYSE Arca its decision to liquidate USMI, terminate the offering and to terminate USMI&#8217;s obligations under the Exchange Act.

&#160;

USCF is required to evaluate the credit risk of UNL to the futures commission merchant (&#8220;FCM&#8221;), oversee the purchase and sale of UNL&#8217;s shares by certain authorized purchasers (&#8220;Authorized Participants&#8221;), review daily positions and margin requirements of UNL and manage UNL&#8217;s investments. USCF also pays the fees of ALPS Distributors, Inc., (&#8220;ALPS Distributors&#8221;), which serves as the marketing agent for UNL (the &#8220;Marketing Agent&#8221;), and Brown Brothers Harriman &#38; Co. (&#8220;BBH&#38;Co.&#8221;), which serves as the administrator (the &#8220;Administrator&#8221;) and the custodian (the &#8220;Custodian&#8221;) for UNL.

&#160;

Limited partners have no right to elect USCF as the general partner on an annual or any other continuing basis. If USCF voluntarily withdraws as general partner, however, the holders of a majority of UNL&#8217;s outstanding shares (excluding for purposes of such determination shares owned, if any, by the withdrawing USCF and its affiliates) may elect its successor. USCF may not be removed as general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and 2/3 percent of UNL&#8217;s outstanding shares (excluding shares owned, if any, by USCF and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of UNL, effective as of March 1, 2013 (as amended from time to time, the &#8220;LP Agreement&#8221;).

&#160;

The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;), which is comprised of four management directors (the &#8220;Management Directors&#8221;), some of whom are also its executive officers, and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca Equities Rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Management Directors have the authority to manage USCF pursuant to the terms of the Sixth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of USCF, dated as of May 15, 2015 (as amended from time to time, the &#8220;LLC Agreement&#8221;). Through its Management Directors, USCF manages the day-to-day operations of UNL. The Board has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes III and Peter M. Robinson). For additional information relating to the audit committee, please see &#8220;Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance &#8211; Audit Committee&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160; 

How Does UNL Operate? 

&#160;

An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor&#8217;s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in natural gas prices. An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the natural gas market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.

&#160;

The net assets of UNL consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for natural gas, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, &#8220;Futures Contracts&#8221;) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other natural gas-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for natural gas, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) transactions that are based on the price of natural gas, oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, &#8220;Other Natural Gas-Related Investments&#8221;). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UNL to invest in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments include those allowing UNL to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments collectively are referred to as &#8220;Natural Gas Interests&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

UNL invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less (&#8220;Treasuries&#8221;), cash and cash equivalents. The daily holdings of UNL are available on UNL&#8217;s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The investment objective of UNL is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares&#8217; per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the daily changes in the average of the prices of 12 futures contracts on natural gas traded on the NYMEX, as measured by the changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, less UNL&#8217;s expenses. When calculating the daily movement of the average price of the 12 contracts each contract month is equally weighted. It is not the intent of UNL to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of natural gas or any particular futures contract based on natural gas. It is not the intent of UNL to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. UNL may invest in interests other than the Benchmark Futures Contracts to comply with accountability levels and position limits. For a detailed discussion of accountability levels and position limits, see &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8211; What are Futures Contracts?&#8221; below in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

UNL seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a mix of Futures Contracts and Other-Natural-Gas Related Investments such that the changes in its NAV will closely track the changes in the price of the NYMEX Futures Contracts for natural gas delivered to Henry Hub Louisiana. USCF believes changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts have historically exhibited a close correlation with the changes in the spot price of natural gas. On any valuation day (a valuation day is any NYSE Arca trading day as of which UNL calculates its NAV as described herein), a Benchmark Futures Contract is the near month contract for natural gas traded on the NYMEX unless the near month contract will expire within two weeks of the valuation day, in which case a Benchmark Futures Contract is the next month contract for natural gas on the NYMEX.

&#160;

USCF believes that holding futures contracts whose expiration dates are spread out over a 12 month period of time will cause the total return of such a portfolio to vary compared to a portfolio that holds only a single month&#8217;s contract (such as the near month contract). In particular, USCF believes that the total return of a portfolio holding contracts with a range of expiration months will be impacted differently by the price relationship between different contract months of the same commodity future compared to the total return of a portfolio consisting of the near month contract. For example, in cases in which the near month contract&#8217;s price is higher than the price of contracts that expire later in time (a situation known as &#8220;backwardation&#8221; in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in natural gas prices the value of the near month contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration. Conversely, in cases in which the near month contract&#8217;s price is lower than the price of contracts that expire later in time (a situation known as &#8220;contango&#8221; in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in natural gas prices the value of the near month contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration. The total return of a portfolio that owned the near month contract and &#8220;rolled&#8221; forward each month by selling the near month contract as it approached expiration and purchasing the next month contract to expire would be positively impacted by a backwardation market, and negatively impacted by a contango market. Depending on the exact price relationship of the different month&#8217;s prices, portfolio expenses, and the overall movement of natural gas prices, the impact of backwardation and contango could have a major impact on the total return of such a portfolio over time. USCF believes that based on historical evidence a portfolio that held futures contracts with a range of expiration dates spread out over a 12 month period of time would typically be impacted less by the positive effect of backwardation and the negative effect of contango compared to a portfolio that held contracts of a single near month. As a result, absent the impact of any other factors, a portfolio of 12 different monthly contracts would tend to have a lower total return than a near month only portfolio in a backwardation market and a higher total return in a contango market. However there can be no assurance that such historical relationships would provide the same or similar results in the future.

&#160;

USCF employs a &#8220;neutral&#8221; investment strategy in order to track changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts regardless of whether the price goes up or goes down. UNL&#8217;s &#8220;neutral&#8221; investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell UNL&#8217;s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in natural gas in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the natural gas or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their natural gas-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in natural gas and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist. In addition, an investment in UNL involves the risk that the daily changes in the average of the prices of UNL&#8217;s shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contracts, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contracts, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of natural gas, in percentage terms.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Benchmark Futures Contracts are changed from the near month contract to expire and the 11 following months to the next month contract to expire and the 11 following months during one day each month. On that day, USCF anticipates it will &#8220;roll&#8221; UNL&#8217;s positions by closing, or selling, its natural gas interests and reinvests the proceeds from closing these positions in new natural gas interests.

&#160;

The anticipated monthly dates on which UNL will &#8220;roll&#8221; its positions are posted on UNL&#8217;s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com, and are subject to change without notice.

&#160;

UNL&#8217;s total portfolio composition is disclosed on its website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading. The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Natural Gas Interest, the specific types of Natural Gas Interests and characteristics of such Other Natural Gas Interests, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UNL&#8217;s portfolio. UNL&#8217;s website is publicly accessible at no charge. UNL&#8217;s assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the &#8220;CEA&#8221;) and CFTC regulations.

&#160;

The shares issued by UNL may only be purchased by Authorized Participants and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called &#8220;Creation Baskets&#8221;. The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Creation Basket. Similarly, only Authorized Participants may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares, called &#8220;Redemption Baskets&#8221;. The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Redemption Basket. The purchase price for Creation Baskets, and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets are the actual NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by UNL. The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day&#8217;s per share NAV and the current price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the day.

&#160;

While UNL issues shares only in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any listed security.

&#160; 

What is UNL&#8217;s Investment Strategy? 

&#160;

In managing UNL&#8217;s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders. USCF instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Natural Gas Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contracts, that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket.

&#160;

By remaining invested as fully as possible in Futures Contracts or Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes in percentage terms in UNL&#8217;s per share NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per share NAV of UNL. Additionally, Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of natural gas. Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that the daily changes in the price of UNL&#8217;s shares traded on the NYSE Arca, on a percentage basis, have closely tracked and will continue to closely track on a daily basis, the daily changes in the spot price of natural gas, on a percentage basis. For performance data relating to UNL&#8217;s ability to track its benchmark, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Tracking UNL&#8217;s Benchmark&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

USCF endeavors to place UNL&#8217;s trades in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments and otherwise manage UNL&#8217;s investments so that &#8220;A&#8221; will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of &#8220;B,&#8221; where:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; A is the average daily change in UNL&#8217;s per share NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days; i.e ., any NYSE Arca trading day as of which UNL calculates its per share NAV; and &#160; &#8226; B is the average daily percentage change in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts over the same period. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in UNL&#8217;s share price on the NYSE Arca, on a percentage basis, to closely track the daily changes in UNL&#8217;s per share NAV, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships and the relationships described above between UNL&#8217;s per share NAV and the Benchmark Futures Contracts will be that the daily changes in the price of UNL&#8217;s shares on the NYSE Arca will closely track, in percentage terms, the changes in the spot price of a barrel of natural gas, less UNL&#8217;s expenses.

&#160;

The specific Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of UNL&#8217;s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts. While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the natural gas market, position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting UNL&#8217;s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. To the extent that UNL invests in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Futures Contracts, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the OTC market. If UNL is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in the Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, a substantial portion of UNL&#8217;s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contracts. As UNL&#8217;s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UNL to invest in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments include those allowing UNL to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8211; Regulation&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on UNL&#8217;s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.

&#160;

USCF may not be able to fully invest UNL&#8217;s assets in the Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to UNL&#8217;s NAV. For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and UNL&#8217;s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts. As a result, in such circumstances, UNL may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts through the use of Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts.

&#160;

UNL anticipates that to the extent it invests in Futures Contracts other than contracts on natural gas (such as futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, diesel-heating oil and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Futures Contracts.

&#160;

USCF does not anticipate letting UNL&#8217;s Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity. Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g., when it changes the Benchmark Futures Contracts or Other Natural Gas-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Futures Contracts or Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.

&#160;

What is the Natural Gas Market and the Petroleum-Based Fuel Market? 

&#160;

Natural Gas . Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of U.S. energy consumption. The price of natural gas is established by the supply and demand conditions in the North American market, and more particularly, in the main refining center of the U.S. Gulf Coast. The natural gas market essentially constitutes an auction, where the highest bidder wins the supply. When markets are &#8220;strong&#8221; ( i.e ., when demand is high and/or supply is low), the bidder must be willing to pay a higher premium to capture the supply. When markets are &#8220;weak&#8221; ( i.e ., when demand is low and/or supply is high), a bidder may choose not to outbid competitors, waiting instead for later, possibly lower priced, supplies. Demand for natural gas by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines overall demand for natural gas. Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, natural gas demand will tend to reflect economic conditions. However, other factors such as weather significantly influence natural gas demand.

&#160;

The NYMEX is the world&#8217;s largest physical commodity futures exchange and the dominant market for the trading of energy and precious metals. The Benchmark Futures Contracts trade in units of 10,000 million British thermal units (&#8220;MMBtu&#8221;) and is based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the nexus of 16 intra- and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region&#8217;s prolific gas deposits. The pipelines serve markets throughout the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and up to the Canadian border. Because of the volatility of natural gas prices, a vigorous basis market has developed in the pricing relationships between the Henry Hub and other important natural gas market centers in the continental United States and Canada. The NYMEX makes available for trading a series of basis swap futures contracts that are quoted as price differentials between approximately 30 natural gas pricing points and the Henry Hub. The basis contracts trade in units of 2,500 MMBtu on the New York Mercantile Exchange ClearPort&#174; trading platform. The New York Mercantile Exchange ClearPort&#174; is an electronic trading platform through which a slate of energy futures contracts are available for competitive trading. Transactions can also be consummated off-NYMEX and submitted to the NYMEX for clearing via the NYMEX ClearPort&#174; clearing website as an exchange of futures for physicals or an exchange of futures for swaps transactions.

&#160; 

Light, Sweet Crude Oil . Light, sweet crudes are preferred by refiners because of their low sulfur content and relatively high yields of high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, diesel-heating oil, and jet fuel. The price of light, sweet crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility.

&#160;

Demand for petroleum products by consumers, as well as agricultural, manufacturing and transportation industries, determines demand for crude oil by refiners. Since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity, crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions. However, other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand.

&#160;

Crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors. Oil prices (along with drilling costs, availability of attractive prospects for drilling, taxes and technology, among other factors) determine exploration and development spending, which influence output capacity with a lag. In the short run, production decisions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (&#8220;OPEC&#8221;) also affect supply and prices. Oil export embargoes and the current conflicts in the Middle East represent other routes through which political developments move the market. It is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors.

&#160; 

Diesel-Heating Oil. Diesel-heating oil, also known as No. 2 fuel oil, accounts for 25% of the yield of a barrel of crude oil, the second largest &#8220;cut&#8221; from oil after gasoline. The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery in the New York harbor, the principal cash market center. The ICE Futures also offers a diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract which trades in units of 42,000 U.S. gallons (1,000 barrels). The diesel-heating Oil Futures Contract is cash-settled against the prevailing market price for heating oil delivered to the New York Harbor.

&#160; 

Gasoline. Gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the U.S. and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption. The gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the NYMEX trades in units of 42,000 gallons (1,000 barrels) and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the New York harbor, the major East Coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the New York harbor area or from the Gulf Coast refining centers. The price of gasoline has historically been volatile.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

What are Futures Contracts? 

&#160; 

Futures Contracts are agreements between two parties. One party agrees to buy a commodity such as natural gas from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed upon when the contract is made. Futures Contracts are traded on futures exchanges, including the NYMEX. For example, the Benchmark Futures Contracts are traded on the NYMEX in units of 10,000 MMBtu. Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an &#8220;open outcry&#8221; of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell. Additional risks of investing in Futures Contracts are included in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160; 

Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits. Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics. Most significantly, futures exchanges and, for certain contracts, the CFTC have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment in UNL is not) may hold, own or control. The net position is the difference between an individual or firm&#8217;s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity. In addition, most U.S.-based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts. Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S.-based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.

&#160;

The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor&#8217;s positions. The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in a Benchmark Futures Contract is 6,000 contracts. In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 12,000 net futures contracts for natural gas. In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its natural gas contract as the NYMEX. If UNL and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for natural gas, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UNL and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UNL could be ordered to reduce its aggregate position back to the accountability level. As of December 31, 2015, UNL held 520 Natural Gas NG Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures. For the year ended December 31, 2015, UNL did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures, however, the aggregated total of the Related Public Funds did exceed the accountability levels.

&#160;

Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that UNL will run up against such position limits because UNL&#8217;s investment strategy is to close out its positions and &#8220;roll&#8221; from the near month contracts to expire to the next month contracts during a one-day period beginning two weeks from expiration of the contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, UNL did not exceed any position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.

&#160;

The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the &#8220;Position Limit Rules&#8221;). The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets (&#8220;DCMs&#8221;) and swap execution facilities (&#8220;SEFs&#8221;) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms. The CFTC&#8217;s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, &#8220;Referenced Contracts&#8221;). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, UNL may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits. Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTC&#8217;s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UNL, but the effect may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UNL to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF&#8217;s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UNL. See &#8220;The Commodity Interest Markets &#8211; Regulation&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

&#160; 

Price Volatility . The price volatility of Futures Contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds. Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day. Futures Contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for natural gas are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by natural gas futures traders throughout the day. Because UNL invests a significant portion of its assets in Futures Contracts, the assets of UNL, and therefore the prices of UNL shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.

&#160;

Marking-to-Market Futures Positions . Futures Contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly. This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account. Therefore, if UNL&#8217;s futures positions have declined in value, UNL may be required to post &#8220;variation margin&#8221; to cover this decline. Alternatively, if UNL&#8217;s futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to UNL&#8217;s account.

&#160; 

Why Does UNL Purchase and Sell Futures Contracts? 

&#160; 

UNL&#8217;s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares&#8217; per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the changes in the average of the prices of 12 futures contracts on natural gas traded on the NYMEX, consisting of the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 months, for a total of 12 consecutive months&#8217; contracts, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 consecutive months, less UNL&#8217;s expenses. When calculating the daily movement of the average price of the 12 Benchmark Futures Contracts, each contract month is equally weighted.

&#160;

In connection with investing in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, UNL holds Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting UNL&#8217;s positions in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. For example, the purchase of a Futures Contract with a stated value of $10 million would not require UNL to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the stated value of the Futures Contract, would be required. To secure its Futures Contract obligations, UNL would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold, through its Custodian or FCM, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract, which at the contract&#8217;s inception would be $10 million minus the amount of the margin deposit, or $9.5 million (assuming a 5% margin).

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As a result of the foregoing, typically 5% to 30% of UNL&#8217;s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with an FCM. In addition to the Treasuries and cash it posts with the FCM for the Futures Contracts it owns, UNL may hold, through the Custodian, Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its OTC contracts. UNL earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases, and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or FCM. UNL anticipates that the earned income will increase the NAV and limited partners&#8217; capital contribution accounts. UNL reinvests the earned income, holds it in cash, or uses it to pay its expenses. If UNL reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.

&#160; 

What are the Trading Policies of UNL? 

&#160;

Liquidity 

&#160;

UNL invests only in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of UNL.

&#160;

Spot Commodities 

&#160; 

While the Futures Contracts can be physically settled, UNL does not intend to take or make physical delivery. UNL may from time to time trade in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of natural gas.

&#160; 

Leverage 

&#160; 

USCF endeavors to have the value of UNL&#8217;s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UNL or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. Commodity pools&#8217; trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract&#8217;s (or other commodity interest&#8217;s) entire market value. While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage UNL&#8217;s assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the LP Agreement.

&#160; 

Borrowings 

&#160; 

Borrowings are not used by UNL, unless UNL is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if UNL trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.

&#160; 

OTC Derivatives (Including Spreads and Straddles) 

&#160; 

In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges. These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the natural gas market. Consequently, UNL may purchase options on natural gas Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.

&#160;

In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in derivatives tied to natural gas. These derivatives transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UNL will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF&#8217;s Board.

&#160;

UNL may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract (&#8220;Exchange for Related Position&#8221; or &#8220;EFRP&#8221; transactions). In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UNL, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UNL&#8217;s shares. These EFRP transactions may expose UNL to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.

&#160;

UNL may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. UNL would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.

&#160;

During the reporting period of this annual report on Form 10-K, UNL limited its derivatives activities to Futures Contracts and EFRP transactions.

&#160; 

Pyramiding 

&#160; 

UNL has not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.

&#160; 

Who are the Service Providers? 

&#160; 

In its capacity as the Custodian for UNL, BBH&#38;Co. may hold UNL&#8217;s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement. BBH&#38;Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the shares. In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for UNL, BBH&#38;Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for UNL and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of UNL. USCF pays BBH&#38;Co.&#8217;s fees for these services.

&#160;

BBH&#38;Co.&#8217;s principal business address is 50 Post Office Square, Boston, MA 02110-1548. BBH&#38;Co., a private bank founded in 1818, is neither a publicly held company nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. BBH&#38;Co. is authorized to conduct a commercial banking business in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the New York State Banking Law, New York Banking Law &#167;&#167;160&#8211;181, and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services. BBH&#38;Co. is also licensed to conduct a commercial banking business by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and is subject to supervision and examination by the banking supervisors of those states.

&#160;

UNL also employs ALPS Distributors as its marketing agent. USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee. In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.

&#160;

ALPS Distributors&#8217; principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203. ALPS Distributors is the marketing agent for UNL. ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

&#160;

On October 8, 2013, USCF entered into a Futures and Cleared Derivatives Transactions Customer Account Agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC (&#8220;RBC Capital&#8221; or &#8220;RBC&#8221;) to serve as UNL&#8217;s FCM, effective October 10, 2013. This agreement requires RBC Capital to provide services to UNL, as of October 10, 2013, in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments that may be purchased or sold by or through RBC Capital for UNL&#8217;s account. For the period October 10, 2013 and after, UNL pays RBC Capital commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of UNL.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

RBC Capital&#8217;s primary address is 500 West Madison Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, Illinois 60661. Effective October 10, 2013, RBC Capital became the futures clearing broker for UNL. Both RBC Capital is registered in the United States with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as an FCM. RBC Capital is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.

&#160;

RBC Capital Markets LLC (RBC) 

&#160;

RBC is a large broker-dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements. As a result, certain of RBC's regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC with respect to issues raised in various investigations. RBC complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in all settlements it reaches. In addition, RBC is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions, a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both in regard to such claims and investigations. RBC complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments made against it. 

&#160;

RBC has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those described below, arising in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. RBC is also involved, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding RBC's business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.

&#160;

RBC contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, RBC believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC.

&#160;

On June 18, 2015, in connection with the SEC's Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation (MCDC) initiative, the SEC commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC Capital Markets, LLC for willful violations of Sections 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) after the firm self-reported instances in which it conducted inadequate due diligence in certain municipal securities offerings and as a result, failed to form a reasonable basis for believing the truthfulness of certain material representations in official statements issued in connection with those offerings. RBC paid a fine of $500,000.

&#160;

On July 31, 2015, RBC Capital Markets, LLC was added as a new defendant in a pending putative class action initially filed in November 2013 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The action is brought against multiple foreign exchange dealers and alleges collusive behavior, among other allegations, in foreign exchange trading. The action is in its initial stages as it relates to the new defendants, including RBC Capital Markets, LLC. On September 11, 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and a motion for authorization of a class action was filed in the Quebec Superior Court, both on behalf of an alleged class of Canadian investors, against Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and a number of other foreign exchange dealers. The Canadian class actions allege that the defendants conspired to manipulate the prices of currency trades and are in their initial stages. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the Foreign Exchange Matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution.

&#160;

On October 14, 2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court of Chancery) in a class action brought by former shareholders of Rural/Metro Corporation, held RBC Capital Markets, LLC liable for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty by three Rural/Metro directors, but did not make an additional award for attorney&#8217;s fees. A final judgment was entered on February 19, 2015 in the amount of US$93 million plus post judgment interest. RBC Capital Markets, LLC appealed the Court of Chancery&#8217;s determination of liability and quantum of damages, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed the ruling on additional attorneys&#8217; fees. On November 30, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Chancery with respect to both the appeal and cross-appeal. RBC Capital Markets, LLC is cooperating with an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to this matter.

On March 11, 2013, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities entered a consent order settling an administrative complaint against RBC, which alleged that RBC failed to follow its own procedures with respect to monthly account reviews and failed to maintain copies of the monthly account reviews with respect to certain accounts that James Hankins Jr. maintained at the firm in violation of N.J.S.A. 49:3-58(a)(2)(xi) and 49:3-59(b). Without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law, RBC consented to a civil monetary penalty of $150,000 (of which $100,000 was suspended as a result of the firm&#8217;s cooperation) and to pay disgorgement of $300,000.

&#160;

On June 12, 2012, the State of Illinois Secretary of State Securities Department consented to entry of a judgment enjoining the firm for violation of the Illinois Securities Law of 1953. RBC undertook to repurchase auction rate securities from certain customers before June 30, 2009. RBC also undertook to use best efforts to provide, by December 31, 2009, liquidity opportunities for customers ineligible for the buyback. RBC undertook to provide periodic reports to regulator. RBC paid a penalty of $1,400,139.82. 

&#160;

On May 10, 2012, FINRA commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC for violations of FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010 and NASD Rules 2110 and 3010 for failing to establish, maintain and enforce written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable rules concerning short-term transactions in closed end funds. RBC paid a fine of $200,000.

&#160;

On May 2, 2012, the Massachusetts Securities Division entered a consent order settling an administrative complaint against RBC, which alleged that RBC recommended unsuitable products to its brokerage and advisory clients and failed to supervise its registered representatives&#8217; sales of inverse and leveraged ETFs in violation of Section 204(a)(2) of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (&#34;MUSA&#34;). Without admitting or denying the allegations of fact, RBC consented to permanently cease and desist from violations of MUSA, pay restitution of $2.9 million to the investors who purchased the inverse and leveraged ETFs and pay a civil monetary penalty of $250,000. 

&#160;

On September 27, 2011, the SEC commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC for willful violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act for negligently selling the collateralized debt obligations to five &#160; Wisconsin &#160; school districts despite concerns about the suitability of the product. The firm agreed to pay disgorgement of $6.6 million, prejudgment interest of $1.8 million, and a civil monetary penalty of $22 million. 

&#160;

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, RBC Europe, Ltd. and RBC USA Holdco Corporation are defendants in a lawsuit relating to their role in transactions involving investments made by a number of Wisconsin school districts in certain collateralized debt obligations. These transactions were also the subject of a regulatory investigation. In September 2011, we reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which was paid to the school districts through a Fair Fund. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or the timing of its resolution; however, management believes the ultimate resolution of this proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

&#160;

Expenses: &#160; Amount as a Percentage of Average Daily Net Assets Amount Paid or Accrued to USCF: &#160; &#160; 0.74% annualized Amount Paid or Accrued in Portfolio Brokerage Commissions: &#160; &#160; 0.04% annualized Other Amounts Paid or Accrued (7) : &#160; &#160; 0.61% annualized Total Expenses Paid or Accrued: &#160; &#160; 1.39% annualized Expenses Waived (8) : &#160; &#160; (0.45)% annualized Total Expenses Paid or Accrued Excluding Expenses Waived (8) : &#160; &#160; 0.94% annualized 

&#160;

(7) Includes expenses relating to legal fees, auditing fees, printing expenses, licensing fees, tax reporting fees, prepaid insurance expenses and miscellaneous expenses and fees and expenses paid to the independent directors of USCF. (8) USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UNL, to the extent that such expenses exceed 0.15% (15 basis points) of UNL&#8217;s NAV, on an annualized basis, through at least April 30, 2016. USCF has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods. &#160;

Other Fees. &#160; UNL also pays the fees and expenses associated with its audit, tax accounting and reporting requirements. These fees were approximately $86,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, UNL is responsible for paying its portion of the directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance for UNL and the Related Public Funds and the fees and expenses of the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of UNL and the Related Public Funds organized as limited partnerships and, as of July 8, 2011, those Related Public Funds organized as a series of a Delaware statutory trust. UNL shares the fees and expenses on a pro rata basis with each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each Related Public Fund computed on a daily basis. These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $569,303 for UNL and the Related Public Funds. UNL&#8217;s portion of such fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3,140.

&#160;

Form of Shares 

&#160; 

Registered Form . Shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the LP Agreement. The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form. The Administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry. USCF recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement. The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company (&#8220;DTC&#8221;).

&#160;

Book Entry . Individual certificates are not issued for the shares. Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede &#38; Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time. Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (&#8220;DTC Participants&#8221;), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (&#8220;Indirect Participants&#8221;), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares. DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants&#8217; accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC&#8217;s Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Shares are credited to DTC Participants&#8217; securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.

&#160;

DTC . DTC has advised UNL as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a &#8220;clearing corporation&#8221; within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a &#8220;clearing agency&#8221; registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.

&#160;

&#160;

Calculating Per Share NAV 

&#160; 

UNL&#8217;s per share NAV is calculated by:

&#160;

&#8226; Taking the current market value of its total assets; &#8226; Subtracting any liabilities; and &#8226; Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares. &#160;

The Administrator, calculates the per share NAV of UNL once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UNL investments (including Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Natural Gas-Related Investments and Treasuries) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH&#38;Co., UNL and USCF. &#8220;Other information&#8221; customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by UNL in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.

&#160;

In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to UNL for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day&#8217;s closing per share NAV of UNL as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the active natural gas Futures Contracts on the NYMEX. The prices reported for those Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day&#8217;s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract. In the event that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Futures Contracts, the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted. The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of UNL&#8217;s investments.

&#160;

The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which UNL&#8217;s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available. During such gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Futures Contracts from the NYMEX&#8217;s immediately preceding trading session. In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Natural Gas-Related Investments and Treasuries held by UNL will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.

&#160;

Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of UNL shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of UNL and the indicative fund value. If the market price of UNL shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if UNL appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy UNL shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short Futures Contracts. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of UNL and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.

&#160; 

Creation and Redemption of Shares 

&#160; 

UNL creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UNL or the distribution by UNL of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.

&#160;

Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of UNL (each such agreement, an &#8220;Authorized Participant Agreement&#8221;). The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by UNL, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Participant. From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2016), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants is $350 for each order placed to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000. Authorized Participants who make deposits with UNL in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UNL or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UNL to effect any sale or resale of shares. As of December 31, 2015, 9 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of UNL. During the year ended December 31, 2015, UNL issued 18 Creation Baskets and redeemed 15 Redemption Baskets.

&#160;

Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical natural gas market and the natural gas futures market. In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy natural gas or sell natural gas or Natural Gas Interests and may profit in these instances. USCF believes that the size and operation of the natural gas market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participant&#8217;s direct activities in the natural gas or securities markets will significantly affect the price of natural gas, Natural Gas Interests, or the price of the shares.

&#160;

Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.

&#160;

Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and UNL under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. 

&#160;

The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Creation Procedures 

&#160; 

On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets. For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a &#8220;business day&#8221; means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the NYMEX or the NYSE is closed for regular trading. Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.

&#160;

By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described below. Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order. Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation request, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.

&#160;

The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UNL for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UNL&#8217;s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Participant&#8217;s purchase of shares.

&#160; 

Determination of Required Deposits 

&#160; 

The total deposit required to create each basket (&#8220;Creation Basket Deposit&#8221;) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UNL (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates. USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day. The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.

&#160;

Delivery of Required Deposits 

&#160;

An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to UNL&#8217;s account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant&#8217;s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date. The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of UNL shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.

&#160;

Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket. UNL&#8217;s per share NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.

&#160; 

Rejection of Purchase Orders 

&#160; 

USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:

&#160;

&#8226; it determines that the investment alternative available to UNL at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective; &#8226; it determines that the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form; &#8226; it believes that the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax consequences to UNL, the limited partners or its shareholders; &#8226; the acceptance or receipt of the Creation Basket Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel to USCF, be unlawful; or &#8226; circumstances outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets. &#160;

None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; Redemption Procedures 

&#160; 

The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent (&#8220;Redemption Order Date&#8221;). The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.

&#160;

By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system to UNL, as described below. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to UNL&#8217;s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.

&#160;

The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system to UNL&#8217;s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order (&#8220;Redemption Distribution Date&#8221;), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with UNL for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet UNL&#8217;s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant&#8217;s sale of shares.

&#160; 

Determination of Redemption Distribution 

&#160; 

The redemption distribution from UNL consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of UNL (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received. USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Delivery of Redemption Distribution 

&#160; 

The redemption distribution due from UNL will be delivered to the Authorized Participant by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, UNL&#8217;s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed. If UNL&#8217;s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if UNL receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to UNL&#8217;s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled. Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to UNL&#8217;s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC&#8217;s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.

&#160;

Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders 

&#160; 

USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders. For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of UNL&#8217;s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption. If USCF has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an OTC contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.

&#160;

Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets. USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares ( i.e. , two baskets) or less.

&#160; 

Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 

&#160; 

To compensate UNL for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to UNL per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order. From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2016), the applicable transaction fee paid by Authorized Participants is $350 for each order they placed to create or redeem one or more baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, this fee was $1,000. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF. USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.

&#160; 

Tax Responsibility 

&#160; 

Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and UNL if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.

&#160; 

Secondary Market Transactions 

&#160;

As noted, UNL creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to UNL or the distribution by UNL of the amount of Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create. Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of UNL at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets and the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Futures Contract market and the market for Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. The prices of shares offered by Authorized Participants are expected to fall between UNL&#8217;s per share NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale. Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Authorized Participants who make deposits with UNL in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either UNL or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or UNL to effect any sale or resale of shares. Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca. Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.

&#160;

Investments 

&#160;

USCF causes UNL to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities. USCF will invest UNL&#8217;s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. When UNL purchases a Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, UNL is required to deposit 5% to 30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under Natural Gas Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC Natural Gas Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on UNL. USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements. USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:

&#160;

&#8226; held on deposit with the FCM or other custodian, &#8226; used for other investments, and &#8226; held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves. &#160;

Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC Natural Gas Interests based on changes in the value of the Natural Gas Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC Natural Gas Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a Natural Gas Interest and each party&#8217;s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and OTC Natural Gas Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of UNL&#8217;s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by UNL will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will be used for UNL&#8217;s benefit.

&#160;

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to UNL to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The assets of UNL posted as margin for Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.

&#160; 

If UNL enters into a swap agreement, UNL must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparties. The amount of collateral UNL posts changes according to the amounts owed by UNL to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by UNL at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.

&#160;

The Commodity Interest Markets 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries. The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g. , contracts for future delivery, forwards, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (e.g. retail or eligible contract participant), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.

&#160;

The offer and sale of shares of UNL, as well as shares of each Related Public Fund, is registered under the Securities Act. UNL and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC. Firms&#8217; participation in the distribution of shares is regulated as described above, as well as by the self-regulatory association, FINRA.

&#160; 

Futures Contracts 

&#160;

A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place. Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals. The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.

&#160;

The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery. The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader. Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.

&#160;

In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market. Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions. The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.

&#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Forward Contracts 

&#160;

A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract. Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts. Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved. Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange. If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date. Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date. In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.

&#160;

In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as UNL or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors. Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.

&#160;

Regulation exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of &#8220;swap&#8221; and, by extension, certain regulatory requirements applicable to swaps (such as clearing and margin). The final exemption does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.

&#160;

While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so. The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions&#8217; currencies. Trading in the interbank market also exposes UNL to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which UNL had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to UNL.

&#160; 

Options on Futures Contracts 

&#160;

Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange. An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest. The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.

&#160;

The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised. The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option. The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.

&#160;

A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels. Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.

&#160;

Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest. Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date. The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value. As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity. An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless. On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.

&#160;

Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium. The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller. Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets. For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract. Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller typically posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Options on Forward Contracts or Commodities 

&#160;

Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts. An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity. However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the OTC market. Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.

&#160; 

Swap Contracts 

&#160;

Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap. Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.

&#160;

Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make. In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty&#8217;s obligation under the swap agreement. If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.

&#160;

Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties. &#8220;Clearing&#8221; refers to the process by which a trade that is bilaterally executed by two parties is submitted to a central clearing counterparty, via a clearing member ( i.e. , an FCM), and replaced by two mirror swaps, with the central clearing counterparty becoming the counterparty to both of the initial parties to the swap. These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty. Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction. In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC. The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading. The CFTC&#8217;s function is to implement the CEA&#8217;s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.

&#160;

The CFTC also regulates the activities of &#8220;commodity trading advisors&#8221; and &#8220;commodity pool operators&#8221; and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons&#8217; activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations. Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF&#8217;s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, UNL or the Related Public Funds.

&#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.

&#160;

Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. The NFA is the only self-regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges. As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation. USCF is a member of the NFA. As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and consumer protection.

&#160;

The CEA requires all FCMs, such as UNL&#8217;s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers&#8217; funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. 

&#160;

The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person&#8217;s trading program or objectives. The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement. Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.

&#160;

Regulations require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations, and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.

&#160;

UNL&#8217;s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA. Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons.

&#160;

The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. Below are discussed several key regulatory items that are relevant to UNL. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. In addition, with regard to any other rules that the CFTC or SEC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on UNL is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.

&#160; 

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Futures Contracts and Position Limits 

&#160;

The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.

&#160;

The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control, (the &#8220;Position Limit Rules&#8221;). The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets (&#8220;DCMs&#8221;) and swap execution facilities (&#8220;SEFs&#8221;) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms. The CFTC&#8217;s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.

&#160;

Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, &#8220;Referenced Contracts&#8221;). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, UNL may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits. Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTC&#8217;s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a ten percent (10%) or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect UNL, but the effect may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UNL to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF&#8217;s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UNL.

&#160;

Margin Requirements 

&#160; 

Futures and Clear Swaps 

&#160;

Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader&#8217;s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts. Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader&#8217;s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the trader&#8217;s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.

&#160;

Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.

&#160;

Brokerage firms, such as UNL&#8217;s clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. The clearing brokers require UNL to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts. This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers&#8217; discretion.

&#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Margin requirements are computed each day by the relevant clearing organization and a trader&#8217;s clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. With respect to trading by UNL, UNL (and not its investors personally) is subject to margin calls.

&#160;

Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.

&#160;

Options 

&#160;

When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she may be required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.

&#160;

OTC Swaps 

&#160;

In October 2015 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Farm Credit Administration, and the FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) jointly adopted final rules to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants (Swap Entities) that are subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies (such entities, Covered Swap Entities, and the joint final rules, the Final Margin Rules).

&#160;

When they take effect, the Final Margin Rules will subject non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities, and between Covered Swap Entities and financial end users that have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of $8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Final Margin Rules), to a mandatory two-way minimum initial margin requirement. The minimum amount of the initial margin required to be posted or collected would be either the amount calculated by the Covered Swap Entity using a standardized schedule set forth as an appendix to the Final Margin Rules, which provides the gross initial margin (as a percentage of total notional exposure) for certain asset classes, or an internal margin model of the Covered Swap Entity conforming to the requirements of the Final Margin Rules that is approved by the Agency having jurisdiction over the particular Covered Swap Entity. The Final Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps with financial end users (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold); and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes.

&#160;

The Final Margin Rules will require minimum variation margin to be exchanged daily for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities and between Covered Swap Entities and all financial end-users (without regard to the swaps exposure of the particular financial end-user). The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap to the Covered Swap Entity, taking into account variation margin previously posted or collected. For non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and financial end-users, variation margin may be posted or collected in cash or non-cash collateral that is considered eligible for initial margin purposes. Variation margin is not subject to segregation with an independent, third-party custodian, and may, if permitted by contract, be rehypothecated.

&#160;

The Fund is not a Covered Swap Entity under the Final Margin Rules but it is a financial end-user. Accordingly, the Fund will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules, which will become effective for the Fund on March 1, 2017. However, the Fund will not have material swaps exposure and, accordingly, the Fund will not be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules.

&#160;

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The CFTC and the SEC are required to adopt their own versions of the Final Margin Rules that are comparable to the Final Margin Rules. The CFTC&#8217;s and SEC&#8217;s rules will only apply to a limited number of registered swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants that are not subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies. The CFTC finalized its margin rules on December 16, 2015. The CFTC&#8217;s rules are substantially the same as the Final Margin Rules. The SEC has yet to finalize its margin rules.

&#160; 

Mandatory Clearing of Swaps 

&#160;

Regulations require that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of &#8220;swap&#8221; be executed on organized exchanges or &#8220;swap execution facilities&#8221; and cleared through regulated clearing organizations (&#8220;derivative clearing organizations&#8221; (&#8220;DCOs&#8221;)), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract and such contract is &#8220;made available to trade&#8221; on a swap execution facility. Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps. As a result, if UNL enters into any of the interest rate or index-based credit default swaps that are subject to these requirements, such swaps will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared. Mandatory clearing and &#8220;made available to trade&#8221; determinations with respect to additional types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require UNL to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.

&#160; 

Other Requirements for Swaps 

&#160;

Swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on an SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements. If UNL engages in non-cleared swap transactions it may be subject to some or all of these requirements.

&#160;

In addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation (&#8220;EMIR&#8221;). EMIR imposes requirements on non-cleared derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the CFTC and other regulators in the United States and which are described above. UNL may be indirectly impacted by EMIR to the extent that it engages in derivatives transactions with counterparties that are subject to EMIR.

&#160;

SEC Reports 

&#160;

UNL makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. These reports are also available from the SEC though its website at: www.sec.gov.

&#160; 

CFTC Reports 

&#160;

UNL also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.
