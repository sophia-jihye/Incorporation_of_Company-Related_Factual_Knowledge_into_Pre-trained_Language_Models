 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Danaher Corporation designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, industrial and commercial products and services, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, innovative technology and major market positions. Our research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service and administrative facilities are located in more than 50 countries. Our business consists of five &#32;segments: Test &#38; Measurement; Environmental; Life Sciences &#38; Diagnostics; Dental; and Industrial Technologies. We strive to create shareholder value through: 

&#8226; 

delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for the types of products and services we provide; 

&#8226; 

upper quartile financial performance compared to our peer companies; and 

&#8226; 

upper quartile cash flow generation from operations compared to our peer companies. 

To accomplish these goals, we use a set of growth, lean and leadership tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (&#8220;DBS&#8221;), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, growth and innovation. Within the DBS framework, we pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives relating to idea generation, product development and commercialization, global sourcing of materials and services, manufacturing improvement and sales and marketing. 

To further these objectives we also acquire businesses that either strategically fit within our existing business portfolio or expand our portfolio into a new and attractive business area. Given the rapid pace of technological development and the specialized expertise typical of our served markets, acquisitions also provide us access to important new technologies and 

domain expertise. We believe there are many acquisition opportunities available within our targeted markets. The extent to which we consummate and effectively integrate appropriate acquisitions will affect our overall growth and operating results. We also continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. 

Danaher Corporation, originally DMG, Inc., was organized in 1969 as a Massachusetts real estate investment trust. In 1978 it was reorganized as a Florida corporation under the name Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc. which in a second reorganization in 1980 became a subsidiary of a newly created holding company named DMG, Inc. DMG, Inc. adopted the name Danaher in 1984 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1986. In this Annual Report, the terms &#8220;Danaher&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to either Danaher Corporation or to Danaher Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 

We have announced our intention to separate our company into two independent, publicly traded companies in the third quarter of 2016. Completion of the separation will create a multi-industry, science and technology growth company that will retain the Danaher name (&#8220;New Danaher&#8221;) and a diversified industrial growth company named Fortive Corporation (&#8220;Fortive&#8221;). New Danaher will consist of Danaher&#8217;s existing Life Sciences &#38; Diagnostics (including Pall Corporation (&#8220;Pall&#8221;)) and Dental segments as well as the water quality and product identification businesses, which in aggregate generated approximately $16.5 billion &#32;of revenue in 2015 (adjusted to include the full annual revenues of Pall for 2015). Fortive will consist of Danaher&#8217;s existing Test &#38; Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business, which in aggregate generated approximately $6.0 billion &#32;of revenue in 2015. The separation is subject to final approval by Danaher&#8217;s Board of Directors and other customary conditions, and will be in the form of a pro rata distribution to Danaher shareholders of 100% of the outstanding shares of Fortive. 

2015 &#32;sales by geographic destination (geographic destination refers to the geographic area where the final sale to the Company&#8217;s customer is made) were: North America, 47% &#32;(including 44% &#32;in the United States); Europe, 25% ; Asia/Australia, 21% &#32;and all other regions, 7% . For additional information regarding sales by geography, please refer to Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. The anticipated spin-off of Fortive in the third quarter of 2016 is expected to change the geographic mix of sales for New Danaher, as the New Danaher businesses realize a higher percentage of overall sales from outside North America than the Fortive businesses.

Prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources. During 2015 &#32;we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Intellectual Property 

We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Danaher. 

Competition 

Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional competitors, competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research, and financial capabilities. We are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new, large companies into certain markets, the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. The number of competitors varies by product and service line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve. Key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price, quality, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, distribution network, breadth of product, service and software offerings and brand name recognition. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months, sales to the United States government are typically stronger in the third calendar quarter, medical and capital 

equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality. 

Working Capital 

We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items. In addition, our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.

We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders as of December 31, 2015 &#32;will be delivered to customers within three to four months of such date. Given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles, we believe that backlog is indicative of short-term revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance. 

Employee Relations 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 81,000 persons, of whom approximately 32,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 49,000 were employed outside of the United States. Of our United States employees, approximately 1,700 were hourly-rated, unionized employees. Outside the United States, we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where many of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;

We conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate. Our research and development efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology. The Company generally conducts research and development activities on a business-by-business basis, primarily in North America, Europe and Asia, although it does conduct certain research and development activities on a centralized basis. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. For a discussion of the risks related 

to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; Customer-sponsored research and development was not significant in 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

Government Contracts 

Although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2015 &#32;was from customers other than governmental entities, each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Regulatory Matters 

We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our products, software and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 

For a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that our operations, products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies, please refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Medical Device and Other Health Care Regulations 

Certain of our products are classified as medical devices under the United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FDCA&#8221;). The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). Our medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries where our products are sold. 

The FDA&#8217;s regulatory requirements include: 

&#8226; 

Establishment Registration . We must register with the FDA each facility where regulated products are developed or manufactured. The FDA periodically inspects these facilities. 

&#8226; 

Marketing Authorization . We must obtain FDA authorization to begin marketing a regulated, 510(k)-non-exempted product in the United States. For some of our products, this authorization is obtained by submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification, which generally provides data on the performance of the product to allow the FDA to determine substantial equivalence to a product already in commercial distribution in the United States. Other of our products must go through a formal pre-market approval process which includes the review of non-clinical laboratory studies and clinical investigations, as well as an inspection by the FDA prior to market approval. 

&#8226; 

Quality Systems . We are required to establish a quality system that includes procedures for ensuring regulated products are developed, manufactured and distributed in accordance with specified standards. We also must establish procedures for investigating and responding to customer complaints regarding the performance of regulated products. 

&#8226; 

Labeling . The labeling for the products must contain specified information. In some cases, the FDA must review and approve the labeling and any quality assurance protocols specified in the labeling. 

&#8226; 

Imports and Exports . The FDCA establishes requirements for importing products into and exporting products from the United States. In general, any limitations on importing and exporting products apply only to products that have not received marketing authorization. 

&#8226; 

Post-Market Reporting . After regulated products have been distributed to customers, we may receive product complaints requiring us to investigate and report to the FDA certain events involving the products. We also must notify the FDA when we conduct recalls involving our products. 

In the European Union, a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with such approval process is represented by the CE mark. To obtain a CE mark, medical devices must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (known as the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. An organization accredited by an EU Member State to certify whether a product meets the essential requirements, also known as a notified body, assesses the quality management systems of the device&#8217;s manufacturer 

and the device&#8217;s conformity to the essential and other requirements within the medical device directive or in vitro diagnostic directive. Our medical device companies are also subject to inspection by notified bodies for compliance. The competent authorities of the EU countries, generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health, oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. We are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner. 

A number of other countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and Japan, have also adopted or are in the process of adopting regulations and standards for medical devices sold in those countries. 

We are also subject to various health care related laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices and the privacy and security of health information, including the United States federal regulations described below. Many states, foreign countries and supranational bodies have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the federal regulations discussed above and below. 

&#8226; 

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. 

&#8226; 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also restricts the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information and requires us to report certain security breaches with respect to such information. 

&#8226; 

The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. 

&#8226; 

The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. 

In addition, certain of our products utilize radioactive material, and we are subject to federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. For a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Export/Import Compliance 

We are required to comply with various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws, including: 

&#8226; 

the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, imposes license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services (which are items specifically designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the United States Munitions List); 

&#8226; 

the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export or re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that potentially have both commercial and military applications); 

&#8226; 

the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and 

&#8226; 

the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 

Other nations&#8217; governments have implemented similar export and import control regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. For a discussion of risks related to export/import control and economic sanctions laws, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

International Operations 

Our products and services are available worldwide, and our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia. We also have operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides greater stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target emerging markets (also referred to in this Report as &#8220;high-growth markets&#8221;). The Company defines high-growth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing rapid growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which includes Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia (with the exception of Japan and Australia).

The manner in which our products and services are sold outside the United States differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the U.S., though we also sell directly from the U.S. into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and, in some cases, directly. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors. 

Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and information about the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion 

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; For a discussion of risks related to our non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Major Customers 

No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 .
