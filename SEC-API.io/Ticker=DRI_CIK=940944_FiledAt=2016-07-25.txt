Segment Information 

We manage our restaurant brands in North America as operating segments. The brands operate principally in the U.S. within full-service dining. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. We have four reportable segments: 1) Olive Garden, 2) LongHorn Steakhouse, 3) Fine Dining (which includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V's) and 4) Other Business (which includes Yard House, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, consumer-packaged goods and franchise revenues). External sales are derived principally from food and beverage sales, we do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales and the customers and long-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions among reportable segments. Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included in Note 6 &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 &#32;Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Strategy 

We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry&#8217;s full-service segment. Generally, the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments: quick service, fast casual, and full service. All of our restaurants fall within the full-service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe we have strong brands, and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full-service restaurant industry. This collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including restaurant operations excellence, brand management excellence, supply chain, talent management and information technology, among other things. 

During fiscal 2016, our operating philosophy was focused on improving the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation, attentive service, engaging atmosphere, and integrated marketing. Darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale, insight, and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages. Additionally, brands can capitalize on insights to deliver customized one-to-one customer relationship marketing. We hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders. 

Recent and Planned Restaurant Growth 

During fiscal 2016 , we added 2 &#32;net new company-owned restaurants in the United States. Our fiscal 2016 &#32;actual restaurant openings and closings, fiscal 2017 projected openings, and approximate capital investment, square footage and dining capacity, by brand, are shown below.

(1) 

Includes the six restaurants transferred to Four Corners as part of the REIT spin-off. 

(2) 

Includes cash investments for building, equipment, furniture and other construction costs; excludes internal capitalized overhead, pre-opening expenses, tenant allowance and future lease obligations. Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse capital investments are based on costs associated with land-only leases; The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, Eddie V's and Yard House capital investments are based on ground and building leases. Actual costs can vary significantly depending on the specific location. 

(3) 

Includes all space under the roof, including the coolers and freezers. 

(4) 

Includes bar dining seats and patio seating, but excludes bar stools. 

The actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2017 will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental permits, complete construction, and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel. Our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands. 

We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant&#8217;s long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process. Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the site&#8217;s visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired. 

We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant&#8217;s performance. If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other brands. Permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas, the expiration of lease agreements, or site concerns. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges. 

Restaurant Operations 

We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. Our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards. 

Each Olive Garden restaurant is led by a general manager, and each LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each also has two to five additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In addition, each restaurant typically employs an average of 50 to 120 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. Restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to ten restaurants. Each director of operations of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse reports to a Senior Vice President of Operations who is responsible for up to one hundred restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards. 

Each Bahama Breeze and Yard House restaurant is led by a general manager, and each The Capital Grille, Seasons 52 and Eddie V's restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each also has two to eight managers. Each The Capital Grille, Seasons 52 and Eddie V's restaurant has one to three executive chefs, and each Bahama Breeze and Yard House restaurant has one to three culinary managers. In addition, each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. The general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations, who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards. 

Our Learning and Employee Development team in partnership with each brand&#8217;s training leader, together with senior operations executives, is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs. These efforts include a 10 to 12-week training program for management trainees (seven to nine weeks in the case of internal promotions) and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand, but includes leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant&#8217;s operating staff. 

We maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level team members. We believe that our leadership position, strong results-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock-based compensation, enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers. 

Quality Assurance 

Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment. Through rigorous supplier and risk based product evaluations, we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications. We rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors. Suppliers that produce &#8220;high-risk&#8221; products are subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (&#8220;HACCP&#8221;) food safety programs and risk based preventative controls adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. We require routine food safety verification for high risk products from our suppliers. Our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation. The total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety. 

Purchasing and Distribution 

Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe, high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1,500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries. Suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products. 

We believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability. Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source top-quality food products at competitive prices. We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen). We actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that Darden incorporates women- and minority-owned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions. 

We continue to drive automation of our supply chain by working with our suppliers, logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility. Through our subsidiary, Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. ("Darden Direct"), and long-term agreements with our third party national distribution companies, we maintain inventory ownership of food and supplies in warehouses primarily dedicated to Darden where practical to do so. Darden Direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into long-term agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with vendors. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales. 

Advertising and Marketing 

Integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full-service dining segment of the restaurant industry. Olive Garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising. Olive Garden supplements this with cable, local television and digital advertising. LongHorn Steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market. The Capital Grille, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and Eddie V's do not use television advertising, but rely on local and digital marketing. Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits, as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests. We also rely on outdoor billboard, direct mail and email advertising, as well as radio, newspapers, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook&#174; and Twitter&#174;, as appropriate, to attract, engage and retain our guests. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and expectations. 

In fiscal 2016, we continued a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society. We also developed and deployed a new online and mobile ordering system for Olive Garden, which was implemented nationwide. In addition, we rolled out table-top tablets to improve the guest experience in all Olive Garden restaurants. During fiscal 2016, we continued exploring brand loyalty and customer relationship management programs for our brands to increase the frequency of visits and offer our guests flexibility when making dining out decisions. As we implement new platforms, we are integrating them into all guest touch points including restaurant operating systems to enable compelling personalized guest experiences. 

&#32;&#32;In fiscal 2016, Olive Garden continued to develop Spanish language advertising to increase awareness and visits from Hispanic consumers. 

Employees 

At the end of fiscal 2016 , we employed approximately 150,000 people (team members) in the United States and Canada. Of these team members, approximately 140,000 were hourly restaurant personnel. The remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field, or were located at one of our restaurant support center facilities in Orlando, Florida or Irvine, California. Our executives have an average of 14 years of experience with us. The restaurant general managers and managing partners average 12 years with us. We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most team members, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

Consistent with one of our core values of diversity, we are committed to attracting, retaining, engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests. Approximately 49 percent of our restaurant team member employees are minorities and over 52 percent are female. According to the People Report's Human Capital Intelligence Report for April 2015, the diversity of our operations leadership teams exceeds industry averages by 4 percentage points for minority and 4 percentage points for female representation. At the vice president level and above, 20 percent of our leaders are minorities and 36 percent are female. The percentages of minority and female leaders at the vice president and above level rank above average in our industry. In addition, we achieved a 100 percent score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for our business practices and policies toward our lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender team members. 

Consistent with our core values of respect and caring and teamwork, in fiscal 1999 we established a program called Darden Dimes to help fellow Darden colleagues in need. Darden Dimes has helped team members weather the after-effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters, severe medical problems and other personal difficulties. Participating team members donate at least 10 cents from each paycheck to the Darden Dimes fund, which raises more than $1.5 million annually. 

Information Technology 

We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. We have implemented technology-enabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control, cost management, guest service and employee effectiveness. These solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand. Our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence. 

Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida. A high-speed data network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night, providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location. Our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently. Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing on-site power backup via a large diesel generator. We use internally developed proprietary software, as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants. 

Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria. 

Competition 

The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers&#8217; discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers &#8220;convenient meals&#8221; in the form of improved entr&#233;es and side dishes from the deli section. In addition, improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas. 

Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled &#8220;Purchasing and Distribution,&#8221; &#8220;Advertising and Marketing&#8221; and &#8220;Information Technology&#8221; in this Item 1 and in our Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

We regard our Darden &#174; , Darden Restaurants &#174; , Olive Garden &#174; , LongHorn Steakhouse &#174; , The Capital Grille &#174; , Yard House &#174; , Bahama Breeze &#174; , Seasons 52 &#174; , Eddie V's Prime Seafood &#174; and Wildfish Seafood Grille &#174; service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely. 

Franchises, Joint Ventures and New Business Development 

As of May 29, 2016 , we operated 1,536 &#32;restaurants through subsidiaries in the United States and Canada all of which are owned by us, except three restaurants located in Central Florida and three restaurants in California. The three restaurants located in Florida and three restaurants located in California are owned by joint ventures managed by us. The joint ventures pay management fees to us, and we control the joint ventures&#8217; use of our service marks. We also have agreements pursuant to which operators run six LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants located in the San Antonio, Texas area and airport locations in Atlanta, Georgia and Detroit, Michigan. 

Our restaurant operations outside of the United States and Canada are conducted through area development and franchise agreements. We have area development and franchise agreements in place with unaffiliated operators to develop and operate Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in: 

&#8226; 

Puerto Rico, 

&#8226; 

Middle East (covering Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), 

&#8226; 

Mexico, 

&#8226; 

Central and South America (one covering Brazil, one covering Colombia and the Dominican Republic, one covering Peru, one covering Ecuador and one covering Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama), and 

&#8226; 

Malaysia. 

The restaurant developments under these agreements are in various states of progress, and the open and operating restaurants are all reflected in the table under the "Introduction" section of this Item 1. We do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees, but we receive royalty income under the area development and franchise agreements. The amount of income we derive from our joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements. 

We distribute several items including Olive Garden salad dressings, salad croutons, extra virgin olive oil, Balsamic vinegar, Parmesan cheese, LongHorn Steakhouse seasoning and Olive Garden seasoning through various distribution channels including wholesale distribution chains and major grocery chains. The amount of income we derive from our distribution arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements. 

Seasonality 

Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals. 

During fiscal 2016 , 12.6 percent &#32;of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant&#8217;s operations. We also are subject in certain states to &#8220;dram-shop&#8221; statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance. 

We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. Changes in these laws during fiscal 2016 &#32;have not had a material effect on our operations. 

We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (&#8220;TRAC&#8221;) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. Through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants, the TRAC agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA tax assessments for unreported cash tips. 

We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2016 , there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated. 

Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (&#8220;ADA&#8221;) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible. 

We continue to review the health care reform law enacted by Congress in March of 2010 (&#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;) and related rules and regulations. As part of that review, we evaluate the potential impacts of this law on our business, and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. 

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. Beginning in 2017, the Affordable Care Act requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request. 

We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. 

See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, data privacy and environmental matters. 

Sustainability 

Darden's commitment to sustainability is embedded as a key component of providing great service and food to our guests. It is an element that separates us from our competitors, and a contributor to our business success. Our approach is both integrated and strategic and spans the enterprise from the commodities we source to the operation of our restaurants. Conservation is a competitive advantage - it will lower our operating costs over time, insulate our supply chain, and help us attract and retain the most qualified employees - all increasing the success of our business. 

More information about our sustainability strategy, how we are implementing that strategy and our progress to date is available through our sustainability report available on our website at www.darden.com/citizenship. 

Darden Foundation and Community Affairs 

We are recognized for a culture that rewards caring for and responding to people. That defines service for Darden. The Darden Restaurants, Inc. Foundation ("Foundation") works to bring to life this spirit of service through its philanthropic support of charitable organizations across the country as well as the volunteer involvement of our team members. The Foundation does this by focusing its philanthropic efforts on programs that enhance the communities in which our team members and guests live and work. 

In fiscal 2016, we awarded approximately $1.8 million in grants through the Foundation. We awarded grants to national organizations such as the American Red Cross, Feeding America, and the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation, as well as local nonprofits including Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida and the Heart of Florida United Way. These organizations provide service to the public through disaster preparedness, hunger relief, community engagement, and the promotion of career opportunities in the culinary industry. 

In 2003, we began the Darden Harvest program as a mechanism for getting fresh and healthy food to people who need it. Each day, across every one of our 1,536 &#32;restaurants, we collect surplus, wholesome food that is not served to guests and, rather than discarding the food, we prepare it for donation to local nonprofit feeding partners. In fiscal 2016, Darden contributed 7.26 million pounds of food which is enough to feed 1,657 families of four, three meals a day for an entire year. As an added benefit of the Darden Harvest program, we are able to divert millions of pounds of surplus food from waste streams every year, making the Darden Harvest program a key part of our goal to one day send zero waste to landfills. 

More information about the Foundation and its efforts to enhance the quality of life in the communities where we do business is available on our website at www.darden.com.
