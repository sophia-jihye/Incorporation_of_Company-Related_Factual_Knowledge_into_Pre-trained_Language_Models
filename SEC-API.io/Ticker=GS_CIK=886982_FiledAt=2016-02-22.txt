Investment Banking 

Investment Banking serves public and private sector clients around the world. We provide financial advisory services and help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their businesses. We seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients the entire resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as the main initial point of contact with Goldman Sachs. 

Financial Advisory. Financial Advisory includes strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings, spin-offs and risk management. In particular, we help clients execute large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including cross-border structuring expertise. Financial Advisory also includes revenues from derivative transactions directly related to these client advisory assignments. 

We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital. 

Underwriting. The other core activity of Investment Banking is helping companies raise capital to fund their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients &#151; who aim to grow the savings of millions of people &#151; with the needs of our public and private sector clients &#151; who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. Our underwriting activities include public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments. Underwriting also includes revenues from derivative transactions entered into with public and private sector clients in connection with our underwriting activities. 

Equity Underwriting . We underwrite common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public offerings for many years. 

Debt Underwriting. We underwrite and originate various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade and high-yield debt, bank loans and bridge loans, including in connection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and growth-market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities.

&#160;

Institutional Client Services 

Institutional Client Services serves our clients who come to the firm to buy and sell financial products, raise funding and manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering market expertise on a global basis. Institutional Client Services makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, we make markets in and clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. 

Our clients are primarily institutions that are professional market participants, including investment entities whose ultimate customers include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or putting aside surplus cash in a deposit account. 

Through our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. As a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Much of this connectivity between the firm and its clients is maintained on technology platforms and operates globally wherever and whenever markets are open for trading. 

Institutional Client Services and our other businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as of December 2015, provided fundamental research on more than 3,400 companies worldwide and more than 40 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities. 

Institutional Client Services generates revenues in four ways: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; In large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury bills, large capitalization S&#38;P 500 stocks or certain mortgage pass-through securities), we execute a high volume of transactions for our clients; 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; In less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds, growth market currencies or certain non-agency mortgage-backed securities), we execute transactions for our clients for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets; 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; We also structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients&#146; risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline); and 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities, as well as securities lending and other prime brokerage services. 

Institutional Client Services activities are organized by asset class and include both &#147;cash&#148; and &#147;derivative&#148; instruments. &#147;Cash&#148; refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). &#147;Derivative&#148; refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond or stock index on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa).

We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry groups, financial measures and individual company stocks.

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Other Prime Brokerage Services. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. In addition, we provide our hedge fund and other clients with a technology platform and reporting which enables them to monitor their security portfolios and manage risk exposures.

&#160;

Investing &#38; Lending 

Our investing and lending activities, which are typically longer-term, include the firm&#146;s investing and relationship lending activities across various asset classes, primarily debt securities and loans, public and private equity securities, and real estate. These activities include investing directly in publicly and privately traded securities and in loans, and also through certain investment funds and separate accounts that we manage and through funds managed by external parties. We also provide financing to our clients. 

Equity Securities. We make corporate, real estate and infrastructure equity-related investments. 

Debt Securities and Loans. We make corporate, real estate, infrastructure and other debt investments. In addition, we provide credit to corporate clients through loan facilities and to individuals primarily through secured loans. 

Investment Management 

Investment Management provides investment and wealth advisory services to help clients preserve and grow their financial assets. Our clients include institutions and high-net-worth individuals, as well as retail investors who primarily access our products through a network of third-party distributors around the world. 

We manage client assets across a broad range of asset classes and investment strategies, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily include hedge funds, credit funds, private equity, real estate, currencies, commodities, and asset allocation strategies. Our investment offerings include those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers as well as strategies managed by third-party managers. We offer our investments in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships, and other commingled vehicles. 

We also provide customized investment advisory solutions designed to address our clients&#146; investment needs. These solutions begin with identifying clients&#146; objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. We draw from a variety of third-party managers as well as our proprietary offerings to implement solutions for clients. 

We supplement our investment advisory solutions for high-net-worth clients with wealth advisory services that include income and liability management, trust and estate planning, philanthropic giving and tax planning. We also use the firm&#146;s global securities and derivatives market-making capabilities to address clients&#146; specific investment needs. 

Management and Other Fees. The majority of revenues in management and other fees is comprised of asset-based fees on client assets. The fees that we charge vary by asset class and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and redemptions. Other fees we receive include financial counseling fees generated through our wealth advisory services and fees related to the administration of real estate assets. 

Assets under supervision include assets under management and other client assets. Assets under management include client assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. Other client assets include client assets invested with third-party managers, bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. Assets under supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients. Long-term assets under supervision represent assets under supervision excluding liquidity products. Liquidity products represent money market and bank deposit assets.

&#160;

Incentive Fees. In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund&#146;s or a separately managed account&#146;s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity funds when the return on a fund&#146;s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. Incentive fees are recognized only when all material contingencies are resolved. 

Transaction Revenues. We receive commissions and net spreads for facilitating transactional activity in high-net-worth client accounts. In addition, we earn net interest income primarily associated with client deposits and margin lending activity undertaken by such clients. 

Business Continuity and Information Security 

Business continuity and information security, including cyber security, are high priorities for Goldman Sachs. Their importance has been highlighted by numerous highly publicized cyber attacks against financial institutions and large consumer-based companies in recent years that resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personal information of clients and customers and the theft and destruction of corporate information, as well as extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Sandy. 

Our Business Continuity Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at the firm&#146;s critical facilities and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a bank holding company, our Business Continuity Program is also subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board. The key elements of the program are crisis planning and management, people recovery, business recovery, systems and data recovery, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology to protect the information provided to us by our clients and that of the firm from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. 

Emplo yees 

Management believes that a major strength and principal reason for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics. 

Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach, and includes an evaluation of an employee&#146;s performance with respect to risk management, compliance and diversity. As of December 2015, we had 36,800 total staff. 

Competition 

The financial services industry &#151; and all of our businesses &#151; are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, products and services, innovation, reputation and price. 

&#160;

&#160;

6 &#160; Goldman Sachs 2015 Form 10-K &#160; &#160; THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. 

Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the United States. We also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them. 

A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking and client execution businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution, such as consumer-oriented deposit-taking activities. 

The provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulation could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the United States and to form and invest in funds outside the United States. Likewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory developments on our competitive position will depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the new regulatory regimes as described further under &#147;Regulation&#148; below. 

We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators inside and outside the United States, including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See &#147;Regulation &#151; Compensation Practices&#148; below and &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K for more information about the regulation of our compensation practices.

Regulation 

&#160;

As a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation worldwide. Our businesses have been subject to increasing regulation and supervision in the United States and other countries, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. 

In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules thereunder, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which we operate. The capital, liquidity and leverage ratios based on the Basel Committee&#146;s final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III), as implemented by the Federal Reserve, the PRA and FCA and other national regulators have also had a significant impact on our businesses. The implications of such regulations for our businesses continue to depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, as well as the development of market practices and structures under the regime established by such regulations. Other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described further throughout this section. 

Banking Supervision and Regulation 

Group Inc. is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act), a financial holding company under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act) and is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. 

Under the system of &#147;functional regulation&#148; established under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization. The primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the Federal Reserve Board exercising a supervisory role. Such &#147;functionally regulated&#148; U.S. non-bank subsidiaries include broker-dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. (GS&#38;Co.), entities registered with or regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities. 

Various of our subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate. 

Our principal U.S. bank subsidiary, GS Bank USA, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). A number of our activities are conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: origination of bank loans; interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; leveraged finance; mortgage origination; structured finance; deposit-taking; and agency lending. 

In addition, Group Inc. has two limited purpose trust company subsidiaries that are not permitted to accept deposits or make loans (other than as incidental to their trust activities) and are not insured by the FDIC. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association that is limited to fiduciary activities, is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company of Delaware, a Delaware limited purpose trust company, is regulated by the Office of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner. 

Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB), our regulated U.K. bank and principal non-U.S. bank subsidiary, is regulated by the PRA and the FCA. GSIB acts as a primary dealer for European government bonds and is involved in market making in European government bonds, lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities. 

In November 2014, a new Single Supervisory Mechanism became effective, under which the European Central Bank and national supervisors both have certain regulatory responsibilities for banks in participating EU member states. While the U.K. does not participate in this new mechanism, it gives new powers to the European Central Bank to take regulatory action with regard to the firm&#146;s banks in Germany and France.

Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements. We are subject to consolidated regulatory capital and leverage requirements set forth by the Federal Reserve Board, and GS Bank USA is subject to capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in substantially the same manner as those applicable to Group Inc., also set forth by the Federal Reserve Board. 

Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s capital adequacy requirements, Group Inc. must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. 

Capital Ratios. We are subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s revised risk-based capital and leverage ratio regulations, inclusive of certain transitional provisions (Revised Capital Framework). These regulations are largely based on Basel III, and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Revised Capital Framework, we are an &#147;Advanced approach&#148; banking organization. The Revised Capital Framework provides for capital buffers (including surcharges) that phase in over time, including a capital conservation buffer, and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge described below, as well as a counter-cyclical capital buffer. 

In July 2015, the Federal Reserve Board approved final rules establishing a capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs. For these institutions, the final rules implement the framework developed by the Basel Committee for assessing the global systemic importance of banking institutions and determining the range of additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) that should be maintained by those deemed to be G-SIBs. 

The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s framework results in surcharges initially ranging from 1% to 4.5%. The final rules treat the Basel Committee&#146;s methodology as a floor (Method One) and introduce an alternative calculation to determine the applicable surcharge (Method Two), which includes a significantly higher surcharge for systemic risk and, as part of the calculation of the applicable surcharge, replaces the Basel Committee&#146;s indicator for substitutability with a new indicator based on a U.S. G-SIB&#146;s use of short-term wholesale funding. Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s final rules, G-SIBs are required to meet the capital surcharges on a phased-in basis beginning in 2016 through January 1, 2019. 

The Revised Capital Framework also provides a counter-cyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% (and also consisting entirely of CET1), to be imposed in the event that national supervisors deem it necessary in order to counteract excessive credit growth. The Federal Reserve Board has proposed, but not yet finalized, its policy for setting the counter-cyclical capital buffer, and several other national supervisors have started to implement this counter-cyclical buffer. The buffer applicable to us could change in the future and, as a result, the minimum ratios we are subject to could increase. 

GS Bank USA computes its capital ratios in accordance with the Revised Capital Framework as an &#147;Advanced approach&#148; banking organization. 

The Basel Committee has published final guidelines for calculating incremental capital requirements for domestic systemically important banking institutions (D-SIBs). These guidelines are complementary to the framework outlined above for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based in order to provide an appropriate degree of national discretion. The impact of these guidelines on the regulatory capital requirements of GS Bank USA and other subsidiaries will depend on how they are implemented by the banking and non-banking regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions. 

In January 2016, the Basel Committee finalized a revised framework for calculating minimum capital requirements for market risk, which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations. The revised framework, among other things: modifies the boundary between the trading book and banking book; replaces value at risk (VaR) and stressed VaR measurements in the internal models approach with an expected shortfall measure that is intended to reflect tail and liquidity risks not captured by VaR; revises the model review and approval process; limits the capital-reducing effects of hedging and portfolio diversification in the internal models approach; provides that securitization exposures will be measured using only the Standardized approach; and makes significant revisions to the methodology for capital requirements under the Standardized approach. The effective date for first reporting under the revised framework is December 31, 2019. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed regulations implementing the revised requirements for U.S. banking organizations.

The Basel Committee has issued a series of updates which propose other changes to capital regulations. In particular, it has finalized a revised standard approach for calculating RWAs for counterparty credit risk on derivatives exposures (&#147;Standardized Approach for measuring Counterparty Credit Risk exposures,&#148; known as &#147;SA-CCR&#148;). In addition, it has published guidelines for measuring and controlling large exposures (&#147;Supervisory Framework for measuring and controlling Large Exposures&#148;), and issued an updated framework for regulatory capital treatment of banking book securitizations. 

The Basel Committee has also issued consultation papers on, among other matters, a &#147;Review of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book,&#148; a &#147;Review of the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework,&#148; revisions to the Basel Standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital, and the design of a capital floor framework based on the revised Standardized approach. 

See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital&#148; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K for information about CET1, CET1 ratio, Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital ratio, Total capital, Total capital ratio, risk-weighted assets (RWAs), and for information about minimum required ratios, as well as applicable capital buffers and surcharges. 

Leverage Ratios. Under the Revised Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. The Revised Capital Framework also introduced a supplementary leverage ratio for Advanced approach banking organizations effective January 1, 2018. 

See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital&#148; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K for information about our Tier 1 leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio. 

Liquidity Ratios. The Basel Committee&#146;s international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests. 

The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is designed to ensure that the entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets based on expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#146; rules implementing the LCR for Advanced approach banking organizations are generally consistent with the Basel Committee&#146;s framework, but include accelerated transitional provisions and more stringent requirements related to both the range of assets that qualify as high-quality liquid assets and cash outflow assumptions for certain types of funding and other liquidity risks. 

Under the accelerated transition timeline, the LCR became effective in the United States on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period whereby firms, including Group Inc. and GS Bank USA, must have an 80% and 90% minimum ratio in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and a 100% minimum ratio commencing in 2017. In November 2015, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule that would require bank holding companies to disclose their LCR on a quarterly basis beginning in the quarter ended September 2016. These requirements include LCR averages over the prior quarter, detailed information on certain components of the LCR calculation and projected net cash outflows. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Risk Management &#151; Liquidity Risk Management&#148; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K for information about the LCR. 

The LCR rule issued by the U.K. regulatory authorities became effective in the United Kingdom on October 1, 2015, with a phase-in period whereby certain financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI), our regulated U.K. broker-dealer subsidiary, must have an 80% minimum ratio initially, increasing to 90% on January 1, 2017 and 100% on January 1, 2018. 

The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is designed to promote more medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance-sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. Under the Basel Committee framework, the NSFR will be effective on January 1, 2018. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the U.K. regulatory authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the NSFR for U.S. banks and bank holding companies, and U.K. financial institutions, respectively.

&#160;

Since January 1, 2015, the enhanced prudential standards implemented by the Federal Reserve Board under the Dodd-Frank Act have required bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity buffer under these rules has some similarities to the LCR (and is described by the agencies as complementary to the LCR), it is a separate requirement that is in addition to the LCR. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Risk Management &#151; Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#148; and &#147;&#151; Liquidity Risk Management&#148; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K for information about our risk management practices and liquidity. 

Stress Tests. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and semi-annual company-run stress tests. The stress test rules require increased involvement by boards of directors in stress testing and public disclosure of the results of both the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s annual stress tests and a bank holding company&#146;s annual supervisory stress tests, and semi-annual internal stress tests. 

We publish summaries of our annual and mid-cycle stress tests results on our web site as described under &#147;Available Information&#148; below. Our annual Dodd-Frank Act stress test submission is incorporated into the annual capital plans that we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve Board as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The purpose of CCAR is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each institution&#146;s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board evaluates an institution&#146;s plan to make capital distributions, such as repurchasing or redeeming stock or increasing dividend payments, across a range of macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions. 

Similar to Group Inc., GS Bank USA is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis, to submit the results to the Federal Reserve Board, and to make a summary of those results public. The rules require that the board of directors of GS Bank USA, among other things, consider the results of the stress tests in the normal course of the bank&#146;s business including, but not limited to, its capital planning, assessment of capital adequacy and risk management practices. 

Dividends and Stock Repurchases. Federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our U.S. depository institution subsidiaries to Group Inc. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA or our national bank trust company subsidiary is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a &#147;recent earnings&#148; test and an &#147;undivided profits&#148; test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year&#146;s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity&#146;s &#147;undivided profits&#148; (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). 

The banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator&#146;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring a payment by a holding company subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve Board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. 

Dividend payments by Group Inc. to its shareholders and stock repurchases by Group Inc. are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board. The dividend and share repurchase policies of large bank holding companies, such as Group Inc., are reviewed by the Federal Reserve Board through the CCAR process, based on capital plans and stress tests submitted by the bank holding company, and are assessed against, among other things, the bank holding company&#146;s ability to meet and exceed minimum regulatory capital ratios under stressed scenarios, its expected sources and uses of capital over the planning horizon under baseline and stressed scenarios, and any potential impact of changes to its business plan and activities on its capital adequacy and liquidity. 

The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s capital planning rule includes a limitation on capital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in the capital plan submission.

&#160;

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a bank holding company commits to a federal bank regulator that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the holding company and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the bank holding company. 

Transactions between Affiliates. Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand, are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. These regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (including credit extensions from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity. In October 2015, the Federal Reserve Board issued a proposed rule that would establish loss-absorbency and related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs. The proposed rule would address U.S. implementation of the Financial Stability Board&#146;s total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) principles and term sheet described below. The proposed rule would require U.S. G-SIBs, such as Group Inc., to maintain minimum external TLAC, consisting of Tier 1 capital and eligible senior and subordinated long-term debt (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity greater than one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria), equal to the greater of (i) 16% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and (ii) 9.5% of total leverage exposure (the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio) commencing January 1, 2019. The RWA component would increase to 18% of RWAs on January 1, 2022. The proposed rule would also require a buffer of CET1 in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the capital conservation buffer (2.5% of RWAs), (ii) the G-SIB surcharge calculated in accordance with the Method One calculation and (iii) any applicable counter-cyclical capital buffer. 

In addition, beginning in 2019, U.S. G-SIBs would also be required to maintain minimum eligible long-term debt equal to the greater of (i) 6% plus the G-SIB surcharge of RWAs and (ii) 4.5% of total leverage exposure. The proposed rule would disqualify from eligible long-term debt, among other instruments, debt securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, as well as structured notes and debt securities not governed by U.S. law. The senior long-term debt of U.S. G-SIBs, including Group Inc., typically permits acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, and therefore would not qualify as eligible long-term debt under the proposed rule. 

&#160;

&#160;

12 &#160; Goldman Sachs 2015 Form 10-K &#160; &#160; THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

The proposed rule would also prohibit Group Inc., as a U.S. G-SIB, from (i) guaranteeing liabilities of subsidiaries that are subject to early termination provisions if the parent company of a U.S. G-SIB enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries, (iii) issuing short-term debt, or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties. Additionally, the proposed rule would cap, at 5% of the value of the U.S. G-SIB&#146;s eligible TLAC, the amount of a U.S. G-SIB&#146;s unsecured non-contingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt. Finally, the proposed rule would require U.S. G-SIBs and other large banking entities to deduct from their own Tier 2 capital certain holdings in unsecured debt of other U.S. G-SIBs, as well as holdings of their own unsecured debt securities. The Federal Reserve Board has also indicated that it is considering imposing subsidiary TLAC requirements on material operating subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs. 

In November 2015, the Financial Stability Board issued a set of final principles and a final term sheet on a new minimum standard for TLAC of G-SIBs. The Financial Stability Board&#146;s final standard also requires certain material subsidiaries of a G-SIB organized outside of the G-SIB&#146;s home country, such as GSI, to maintain amounts of TLAC to facilitate the transfer of losses from operating subsidiaries to the parent company. 

Also, in November 2015, the Basel Committee issued a proposal to implement internationally the capital deductions for G-SIBs&#146; holdings of the TLAC of other G-SIBs and their own, which will inform how the deductions are implemented by other national regulators. 

In December 2015, the Bank of England published a consultation paper on its approach for setting a &#147;minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities&#148; (MREL) under which certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI, would need to maintain equity and liabilities sufficient to credibly bear losses in resolution. MREL is generally consistent with the Financial Stability Board&#146;s TLAC standard. 

The proposed MREL is the sum of a loss absorption amount and a recapitalization amount. The loss absorption amount is based on a firm&#146;s minimum going-concern capital requirement, which currently consists of Pillar 1 (the minimum capital requirement under the fourth EU Capital Requirements Directive and EU Capital Requirements Regulation, collectively known as CRD IV), plus Pillar 2A (an additional amount to cover risks not adequately captured in Pillar 1). The recapitalization amount is based on a firm&#146;s recapitalization needs post-resolution and any additional requirements to be determined by the Bank of England as necessary to maintain market confidence. 

Resolution and Recovery. Each bank holding company with over $50 billion in assets and each designated systemically important financial institution is required by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to provide an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). Our resolution plan must, among other things, demonstrate that GS Bank USA is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. The regulators&#146; joint rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of the company&#146;s material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. If the regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to cure identified shortcomings in its resolution plan and that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations or may jointly order the institutions to divest assets or operations in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. 

We are also required by the Federal Reserve Board to submit, on an annual basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that management could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. 

The FDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to provide a resolution plan. Similar to our resolution plan for Group Inc., our resolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities.

&#160;

The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (the BRRD) required EU member states to grant, by January 1, 2016, &#147;bail-in&#148; powers to EU resolution authorities to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the EU (including GSI) must provide that new contracts entered into after January 1, 2016 enable such actions and also amend pre-existing contracts governed by non-EU law to enable such actions, when the financial institutions could incur liabilities under such pre-existing contracts after January 1, 2016. 

Separately, under the BRRD, financial contracts not governed by EU law are required to be amended so that the resolution authorities can impose a temporary stay of termination in resolution. These requirements must be implemented over 2016 and 2017, with the timing depending on the category of the counterparty of the financial institution. The BRRD also subjects investment firms to MREL so that they can be resolved without causing financial instability and without recourse to public funds in the event of a failure. In July 2015, the European Banking Authority published final draft Regulatory Technical Standards on MREL, which specify the common criteria under the BRRD. The Bank of England&#146;s proposal on MREL is described above under &#147;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity.&#148; 

Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; To transfer any of the depository institution&#146;s assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed &#147;bridge&#148; bank, without the approval of the depository institution&#146;s creditors; 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; To enforce the depository institution&#146;s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution. 

In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debt holders of the institution, in the &#147;liquidation or other resolution&#148; of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debt holders (other than depositors) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors of GS Bank USA. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime (known as &#147;orderly liquidation authority&#148;) for bank holding companies and their affiliates that are systemically important and certain non-bank financial companies. Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution&#146;s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under the orderly liquidation authority would avoid or mitigate those effects. 

If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under the orderly liquidation authority, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors&#146; claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a &#147;bridge&#148; entity. In addition, the orderly liquidation authority limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership.

&#160;

The orderly liquidation authority provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective upon enactment. The FDIC has completed several rulemakings and taken other actions under the orderly liquidation authority, including the issuance of a notice describing some elements of its &#147;single point of entry&#148; or &#147;SPOE&#148; strategy pursuant to the orderly liquidation authority provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this strategy, the FDIC would, among other things, resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets to a &#147;bridge&#148; holding company. 

In November 2015, we, along with a number of other major global banking organizations, adhered to an updated version of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Resolution Stay Protocol (the ISDA Protocol) that was developed in coordination with the Financial Stability Board. The ISDA Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivatives contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under the orderly liquidation authority in the United States. The initial version, which addressed ISDA derivatives contracts, took effect in January 2015, and the updated version, which was revised to also cover securities financing transactions, took effect in January 2016. The ISDA Protocol is expected to be adopted more broadly in the future, following the adoption of regulations by banking regulators, and expanded to include instances where a U.S. financial holding company becomes subject to proceedings under the U.S. bankruptcy code. 

FDIC Insurance. GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC&#146;s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. The amounts of these assessments for larger depository institutions (generally those that have $10 billion in assets or more), such as GS Bank USA, are currently based on the average total consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, the supervisory ratings of the insured depository institution and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. The assessment rate is subject to adjustment by the FDIC. 

In October 2015, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would increase the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35% of total insured deposits. The proposed rule would impose a surcharge on the assessments of larger depository institutions, beginning the quarter after the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15% and continuing through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% and December 31, 2018. Under the proposed rule, if the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC would impose a shortfall assessment on larger depository institutions, including GS Bank USA. 

Prompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described under &#147;Resolution and Recovery, and Insolvency &#151; Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company&#148; above. 

The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding company&#146;s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary&#146;s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the holding company, the guarantee would take priority over the holding company&#146;s general unsecured creditors, as described under &#147;Source of Strength&#148; above.

&#160;

Activities. The Dodd-Frank Act and the BHC Act generally restrict bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. 

Volcker Rule. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the &#147;Volcker Rule&#148; became effective in July 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits &#147;proprietary trading,&#148; but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record keeping requirements. The reporting requirements include calculating daily quantitative metrics on covered trading activities (as defined in the rule) and providing these metrics to regulators on a monthly basis. 

In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, &#147;covered funds&#148; (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including Group Inc. and its subsidiaries. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to reduce our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund&#146;s net asset value, and to reduce our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital. 

In December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board extended the conformance period through July 2016 for investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013, and indicated that it intends to further extend the conformance period through July 2017. 

See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Regulatory Developments &#151; Volcker Rule&#148; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K for information about our investments in covered funds. 

Other Restrictions. Financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for bank holding companies as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding companies. The broader range of permissible activities for financial holding companies includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-financial companies. In addition, financial holding companies are permitted under the GLB Act to engage in certain commodities activities in the United States that may otherwise be impermissible for bank holding companies, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets. 

The Federal Reserve Board, however, has the authority to limit a financial holding company&#146;s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the financial holding company does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the Federal Reserve Board. For example, if a financial holding company or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the Federal Reserve Board may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the financial holding company may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. 

In addition, we are required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the United States. 

Single-counterparty credit limits and early remediation requirements have been proposed but are still under consideration by the Federal Reserve Board. The proposed single-counterparty credit limits impose more stringent requirements for credit exposure among major financial institutions, which (together with other provisions incorporated into the Basel III capital rules) may affect our ability to transact or hedge with other financial institutions. The proposed early remediation rules are modeled on the prompt corrective action regime, described under &#147;U.S. Deposit Insurance and Prompt Corrective Action&#148;, but are designed to require action to begin in earlier stages of a company&#146;s financial distress, based on a range of triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management.

&#160;

If any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the financial holding company would be subject to similar restrictions on activities. 

In addition, New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA&#146;s activities. 

During the past several years, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have raised concerns over origination and other practices in leveraged lending markets. The agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. 

Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation 

Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients&#146; funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of clients&#146; purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&#38;Co. is registered as a broker-dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&#38;Co. 

In addition, state securities and other regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&#38;Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices, as described further below, as well as under &#147;Other Regulation.&#148; GSEC is a registered U.S. broker-dealer and is regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&#38;Co. and GSEC, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K. 

In Europe, we provide broker-dealer services that are subject to oversight by national regulators as well as EU regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which implement EU directives, and increasingly by directly applicable EU regulations. These national and EU laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. 

We provide broker-dealer services in and from the United Kingdom under the regulation of the PRA and the FCA. GSI, our regulated U.K. broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to capital requirements imposed by the PRA. GSI also has its own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the PRA&#146;s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#151; Subsidiary Capital Requirements&#148; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K for information about GSI&#146;s capital ratios. 

Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan&#146;s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, among others. 

Also, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Securities Exchange, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the SEC. Various of our other subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate, including, among others, Brazil and Dubai. 

Our exchange-based market-making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act will result in additional regulation by the SEC, the CFTC and other regulators of our broker-dealer and regulated subsidiaries in a number of respects. The legislation calls for the imposition of expanded standards of care by market participants in dealing with clients and customers, including by providing the SEC with authority to adopt rules establishing fiduciary duties for broker-dealers and directing the SEC to examine and improve sales practices and disclosure by broker-dealers and investment advisers. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued proposed rules defining the circumstances in which a person would be treated as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by reason of providing investment advice to retirement plans and individual retirement accounts, as well as proposed exemptions. 

Our broker-dealer and other subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates an asset-backed security transaction to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. Securitizations would also be affected by rules proposed by the SEC to implement the Dodd-Frank Act&#146;s prohibition against securitization participants engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with an investor in a securitization transaction. The proposed rules would exempt bona fide market-making activities and risk-mitigating hedging activities in connection with securitization activities from the general prohibition. 

The SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations. 

Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation 

The commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the United States is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. Several of our subsidiaries, including GS&#38;Co. and GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors or (as described below) swap dealers, and are subject to CFTC regulations. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern the commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities of these entities. In addition, Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives activities. 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides for significantly increased regulation of, and restrictions on, derivative markets and transactions. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes the following requirements relating to swaps and security-based swaps: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Real-time public and regulatory reporting of trade information for swaps and security-based swaps and large trader reporting for swaps; 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC; 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Position limits, aggregated generally across commonly controlled accounts and commonly controlled affiliates, that cap exposure to derivatives on certain physical commodities; 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated exchanges or electronic facilities for certain swaps and security-based swaps; 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; New business conduct standards and other requirements for swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, covering their relationships with counterparties, internal oversight and compliance structures, conflict of interest rules, internal information barriers, general and trade-specific record-keeping and risk management; 

&#160;

&#160;

18 &#160; Goldman Sachs 2015 Form 10-K &#160; &#160; THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Margin requirements for trades that are not cleared through a central counterparty; and 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Entity-level capital requirements for swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants. 

The terms &#147;swaps&#148; and &#147;security-based swaps&#148; are generally defined broadly for purposes of these requirements, and can include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally called swaps. The definition includes certain forward contracts, options, certain loan participations and guarantees of swaps, subject to certain exceptions, and relates to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations. 

The CFTC is responsible for issuing rules relating to swaps, swap dealers and major swap participants, and the SEC is responsible for issuing rules relating to security-based swaps, security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies (acting jointly) adopted final rules in October 2015 and the CFTC adopted final margin rules for uncleared swaps in December 2015 that will phase in variation margin requirements from September 1, 2016 through March 1, 2017 and initial margin requirements from September 1, 2016 through September 1, 2020, depending on the level of swaps and foreign exchange forward transaction activity of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. The final rules of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies would generally apply to inter-affiliate transactions, with limited relief available from the initial margin requirements for affiliates that have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. Under the CFTC final rules, inter-affiliate transactions would be exempt from initial margin requirements with certain exceptions, but variation margin requirements would still apply. We expect the SEC to adopt margin regulations as well in 2016. 

The CFTC has not yet finalized its capital regulations for swap dealers. However, many of the requirements, including registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of certain swaps, business conduct standards and real-time public trade reporting, have taken effect already under CFTC rules, and the SEC and the CFTC have finalized the definitions of a number of key terms. Finally, the CFTC has begun to decide which swaps must be cleared through central counterparties and executed on swap execution facilities or exchanges. In particular, certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps are now subject to these clearing and trade-execution requirements. The CFTC is expected to continue to make such determinations during 2016. 

The SEC has adopted rules relating to trade reporting and real-time reporting requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The SEC has also adopted final rules relating to the registration of security-based swap dealers, but such registration is not currently required. The SEC has proposed, but not yet finalized, rules to impose margin, capital, segregation and business conduct requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The SEC has also proposed rules that would govern the design of new trading venues for security-based swaps and establish the process for determining which products must be traded on these venues. 

We have registered certain subsidiaries as &#147;swap dealers&#148; under the CFTC rules, including GS&#38;Co., GS Bank USA, GSI and J. Aron &#38; Company. We also expect to register certain subsidiaries as security-based swap dealers. We expect that these subsidiaries, and our businesses more broadly, will continue to be subject to significant and developing regulation and regulatory oversight in connection with swap-related activities. 

Similar regulations have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the United States, including the adoption of standardized execution and clearing, margining and reporting requirements for OTC derivatives. For instance, the EU has established regulatory requirements for OTC derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, including requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, which have already taken effect, as well as requirements relating to clearing and margining for uncleared derivatives, which are currently expected to be finalized during 2016.

&#160;

The CFTC and SEC have issued guidance and rules relating to swap activities. The CFTC has provided guidance and timing on the cross-border regulation of swaps and announced that it had reached an understanding with the European Commission regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the common goals underlying their respective regulations. The CFTC also approved certain comparability determinations that would permit substituted compliance with non-U.S. regulatory regimes for certain swap regulations related to certain business conduct requirements, including chief compliance officer duties, conflict of interest rules, monitoring of position limits, record-keeping and risk management. The SEC issued rules and guidance on cross-border security-based swap activities and the CFTC issued proposed rules that would determine the circumstances under which registered swap dealers would be subject to the CFTC&#146;s rules regarding margin in connection with uncleared swaps in cross-border transactions. In particular, under the proposal, certain non-U.S. swap dealers would generally be required to comply with the CFTC&#146;s rules but, with respect to the requirement to post margin, these non-U.S. swap dealers would be permitted to comply with comparable margin requirements in a foreign jurisdiction, subject to the CFTC&#146;s approval of the particular jurisdiction. Substituted compliance would also be available with respect to the collection of margin in certain circumstances. The CFTC&#146;s rules will only be applicable to those swap dealers that are not subject to the margin requirements of a prudential regulator. 

The application of new derivatives rules across different national and regulatory jurisdictions has not yet been fully established and specific determinations of the extent to which regulators in each of the relevant jurisdictions will defer to regulations in other jurisdictions have not yet been completed. The full impact of the various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory developments in this area will not be known with certainty until all the rules are finalized and implemented and market practices and structures develop under the final rules. 

J. Aron &#38; Company is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron &#38; Company is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities, Group Inc. is also an &#147;exempt holding company&#148; under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules. 

In addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities activities, we are subject to energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as described under &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Investment Management Regulation 

Our investment management business is subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our management of client funds. 

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. The SEC recently adopted amendments to the rules that govern SEC-registered money market mutual funds. The new rules require institutional prime money market funds to value their portfolio securities using market-based factors and to sell and redeem their shares based on a floating net asset value. In addition, the rules allow, in certain circumstances, for the board of directors of money market mutual funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates and also require additional disclosure, reporting and stress testing. Certain reporting requirements became effective during 2015, and the firm&#146;s money market mutual funds will be required to comply with the amendments relating to floating net asset value, fees and redemption gates and stress testing in 2016. 

In September 2015, the SEC also proposed rules that would require registered funds to adopt and implement liquidity risk management programs, including establishing a minimum percentage of net assets that could be invested only in assets offering three-day liquidity and classifying and reviewing the liquidity of fund portfolio assets; permit funds to employ &#147;swing pricing,&#148; under which the net asset value of a fund&#146;s shares may be adjusted in order to pass the cost of trading in such shares to purchasing or redeeming shareholders; and require related disclosures.

&#160;

In December 2015, the SEC also proposed a new rule regulating the use of derivatives by registered funds. Under the proposed rule, a registered fund would be required to, among other things, comply with one of two alternative portfolio limitations designed to impose a limit on the total amount of leverage the fund can obtain through derivatives transactions; maintain a minimum amount of &#147;qualifying coverage assets&#148; (generally limited to cash and cash equivalents) to support payment obligations for each derivative transaction; establish a derivatives risk management program if derivative use meets specified thresholds; and comply with new recordkeeping, disclosure and reporting requirements related to its use of derivatives. 

Certain of our European subsidiaries are subject to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and related regulations, which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of EU-based alternative investment managers and the ability of alternative investment fund managers located outside the EU to access the EU market. 

The European Commission has published a proposal relating to money market funds, including provisions prescribing minimum levels of daily and weekly liquidity, clear labeling of money market funds, a 3% capital buffer for constant net asset value funds and internal credit risk assessments. 

Compensation Practices 

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other financial regulatory bodies worldwide. The scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop, and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will evolve over a number of years. 

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness. 

The Financial Stability Board has released standards for implementing certain compensation principles for banks and other financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation practices. These standards are to be implemented by local regulators. In the EU, CRD IV includes compensation provisions designed to implement the Financial Stability Board&#146;s compensation standards. These rules have been implemented by EU member states and, among other things, limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of certain employees, including those identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of EU-regulated entities, including GSI. 

The EU has also introduced rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds. These requirements are in addition to the guidance issued by U.S. financial regulators described above and the Dodd-Frank Act provision described below. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Goldman Sachs 2015 Form 10-K &#160; 21 THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (which would include Group Inc. and some of its depository institution, broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries) that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The initial version of these regulations was proposed by the U.S. financial regulators in early 2011 but the regulations have not yet been finalized. The proposed regulations incorporate the three key principles from the regulatory guidance described above. If the regulations are adopted in the form proposed, they may restrict our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we structure compensation. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations 

The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain some similar provisions. 

In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. The obligation of financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to monitor direct and indirect payments to government officials, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls. 

Other Regulation 

The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions and other state regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity or its directors, officers or employees. In addition, a number of our other activities require us to obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject to the oversight of various regulators in the jurisdictions in which we conduct these activities. 

The EU finalized the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (collectively, MiFID II). These include new extensive market structure reforms, such as the establishment of new trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform, enhanced pre- and post-trade transparency covering a wider range of financial instruments and a reform of the equities markets. Commodities trading firms will be required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific limits. Other reforms introduce enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, investor protection-related and organizational requirements. Other requirements may affect the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research. On February 10, 2016, the European Commission proposed delaying the effectiveness of MiFID II until January 2018. 

The EU and national financial legislators and regulators have proposed or adopted numerous further market reforms that may impact our businesses, including heightened corporate governance standards for financial institutions and rules on indices that are used as benchmarks for financial instruments or funds. In addition, the European Commission, the European Securities Market Authority and the European Banking Authority have announced or are formulating regulatory standards and other measures which will impact our European operations. Certain of our subsidiaries are also regulated by the European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members.

The European Commission has published a proposal for a common system of financial transactions tax which would be implemented in certain EU member states willing to engage in enhanced cooperation in this area. The proposed financial transactions tax is broad in scope and would apply to transactions in a wide variety of financial instruments and derivatives. The European Commission has also published a draft proposal for structural reform of EU banks, which would prohibit certain banks from proprietary trading and would require separating certain trading activities from deposit-taking entities. 

As described above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based upon its underlying risk. 

Certain of our businesses are subject to laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the EU or other jurisdictions and/or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, including the GLB Act, the EU Data Protection Directive, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, the Australian Privacy Act and the Brazilian Bank Secrecy Law.

Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 

&#160; &#160; &#160;

We have included or incorporated by reference in the 2015 Form 10-K, and from time to time our management may make, statements that may constitute &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may also include statements about the effect of changes to the capital, leverage, liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity rules applicable to banks and bank holding companies, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our businesses and operations, and various legal proceedings or mortgage-related contingencies as set forth in Notes 27 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K, as well as statements about the results of our Dodd-Frank Act and firm stress tests, statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, statements about trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements about our future status, activities or reporting under U.S. or non-U.S. banking and financial regulation, and statements about our investment banking transaction backlog. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those described below and under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Statements about the agreement in principle to resolve the RMBS Working Group investigation and its impact on the firm&#146;s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are based on the firm&#146;s current expectations regarding the ultimate terms of the definitive settlement documentation. The agreement in principle is subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation, and there can be no assurance that the firm, the U.S. Department of Justice and the other applicable governmental authorities will agree on the definitive documentation. Accordingly, the effects of the definitive settlement, as well as the firm&#146;s ability to negotiate definitive documentation for the settlement, may change materially from what is currently expected. 

Statements about our investment banking transaction backlog are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For information about other important factors that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions, see &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K. 

We have provided in this filing information regarding the firm&#146;s capital ratios, including the CET1 ratios under the Advanced and Standardized approaches on a fully phased-in basis, as well as the LCR and the supplementary leverage ratios for the firm and GS Bank USA. The statements with respect to these ratios are forward-looking statements, based on our current interpretation, expectations and understandings of the relevant regulatory rules and guidance, and reflect significant assumptions concerning the treatment of various assets and liabilities and the manner in which the ratios are calculated. As a result, the methods used to calculate these ratios may differ, possibly materially, from those used in calculating the firm&#146;s capital, liquidity and leverage ratios for any future disclosures. The ultimate methods of calculating the ratios will depend on, among other things, implementation guidance or further rulemaking from the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards.
