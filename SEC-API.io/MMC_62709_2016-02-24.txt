Compensation for Services in Risk and Insurance Services 

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services through commissions and fees. Commission rates and fees vary in amount and can depend upon a number of factors, including the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer selected, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. In addition to compensation from its 

clients, Marsh also receives compensation from insurance companies. This compensation includes, among other things, payments for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; fees for administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions, which are paid by insurers based on the attainment of specified goals relating to Marsh's placements, particularly at Marsh &#38; McLennan Agency and in parts of Marsh's international operations. 

Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others.

For a majority of the Mercer-managed investment funds, revenue received from Mercer's investment management clients as sub-advisor fees is reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, on a gross basis rather than a net basis. For a more detailed discussion of revenue sources and factors affecting revenue in the Consulting segment, see Part II, Item 7 ("Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") of this report. 

REGULATION 

The Company's activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as laws of other countries in which the Company's subsidiaries operate. 

See Part I, Item 1A ("Risk Factors") below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses. 

Risk and Insurance Services . While laws and regulations vary from location to location, every state of the United States and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers (such as insurance brokers, agents and consultants, reinsurance brokers and managing general agents) to hold an individual or company license from a government agency or self-regulatory organization. Some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in those instances, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process. Licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers, and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses. 

The Insurance Mediation Directive was adopted by the United Kingdom and 26 other European Union Member States in 2005. Its implementation gave powers to the Financial Services Authority ("FSA"), the United Kingdom regulator at the time, to expand their responsibilities in line with the Financial Services and Markets Act, the result of which was the regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries. The enhanced regulatory regime effected a licensing system based on an assessment of factors which included professional competence, financial capacity and the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance. In April 2013, the FSA was superseded by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"). In April 2014, the FCA&#8217;s responsibilities were expanded further to include the regulation of credit activities for consumers. This included the broking of premium finance to consumers who wished to spread the cost of their insurance. In April 2015, the FCA obtained their concurrent competition powers enabling them to enforce the prohibitions on anti-competitive behavior in relation to financial services. 

Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which the Company's subsidiaries do business, including the FCA in the United Kingdom, also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them, and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business. The FCA is currently reviewing its rules drafted to protect client assets and client money. If deemed appropriate, the FCA will implement changes intended to provide enhanced protection to client funds. 

Certain of the Company's Risk and Insurance Services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities LLC (formerly MMC Securities Corp.), a broker-dealer, investment adviser and introducing broker. MMC Securities LLC is registered in the United States with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), the National Futures Association and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC"), primarily in connection with capital markets and other investment banking-related services relating to insurance-linked and alternative risk financing transactions. Also in the United States, Marsh uses the services of MMA Securities LLC (formerly NIA Securities, LLC), a U.S. registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, SIPC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. In the United Kingdom, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the expertise of MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FCA to provide advice on securities and investments, including mergers &#38; acquisitions in the European Union. MMC Securities LLC, MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, MMA Securities LLC and Marsh Investment Services Limited are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marsh &#38; McLennan Companies, Inc. 

Consulting . Certain of Mercer's retirement-related consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries. In addition, the trustee services, investment services (including advice to persons, institutions and other entities on the investment of pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are also subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions, including regulations imposed or enforced by the SEC and the Department of Labor in the United States, the FCA in the United Kingdom, 

the Central Bank of Ireland and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. In the United States, Mercer provides investment services through Mercer Investment Management, Inc. and Mercer Investment Consulting LLC, each an SEC-registered investment adviser. Mercer Trust Company, a New Hampshire chartered trust bank, provides services for Mercer&#8217;s benefits administration and investment management business in the United States. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. Mercer uses the services of MMC Securities LLC in connection with the provision of certain retirement and employee benefit services. Oliver Wyman Group uses the services of MMC Securities LLC in the United States and MMC Securities (Europe) Limited in the European Union, primarily in connection with corporate finance advisory services. 

FATCA . Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and related legislation (FATCA) require the Company to take various measures relating to non-U.S. funds, transactions and accounts. The regulations impose on Mercer certain client financial account tracking and disclosure obligations with respect to non-U.S. financial institution and insurance clients, and require Marsh and Guy Carpenter (and Mercer, in limited circumstances) to collect, validate and maintain certain documentation from each foreign insurance entity that insures a risk that is subject to the regulations. The Company has adopted processes to substantially address FATCA&#8217;s requirements. Barring U.S. Treasury action to scale back FATCA in 2016, FATCA&#8217;s application is due to expand as of January 1, 2017 to regulate a broader set of insurance and reinsurance placements, known as "foreign-to-foreign" transactions. Though this expansion of FATCA&#8217;s reach may be delayed or permanently suspended, the Company has begun to undertake measures to also achieve timely compliance with FATCA&#8217;s foreign-to-foreign requirements. 

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS 

The Company faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services, including competition with regard to identifying and pursuing acquisition candidates. The Company also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees. In addition to the discussion below, see "Risks Relating to the Company Generally-Competitive Risks," in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 

Risk and Insurance Services . The Company's combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope. The principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance 

businesses compete include the complexity, range, quality and cost of the services and products offered to clients. The Company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market, distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms, consultants and web search engines, that provide risk-related services and products or alternatives to traditional brokerage services. 

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. Certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers. There are also many other providers of managing general agency, affinity programs and private client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions. 

Consulting . The Company's consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional and local firms. These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms. 

Mercer's investments business faces competition from many sources, including investment consulting firms (many of which offer delegated services) and other financial institutions. In some cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group internally, without assistance from outside advisors. 

Segmentation of Activity by Type of Service and Geographic Area of Operation.
