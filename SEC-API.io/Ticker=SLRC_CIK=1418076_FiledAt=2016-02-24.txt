 Item 1. Business Solar Capital Ltd. (&#147;Solar&#148;, &#147;Solar Capital&#148;, the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148; or &#147;our&#148;), a Maryland corporation formed in November 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (or &#147;BDC&#148;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). Furthermore, as the Company is an investment company, it continues to apply the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 946. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). 

In February 2010, we completed our initial public offering and a concurrent private offering of shares to our senior management team. 

We invest primarily in U.S. middle market companies, where we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment opportunities are most attractive. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in leveraged middle market companies in the form of senior secured loans, mezzanine loans and equity securities. We define &#147;middle market&#148; to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly traded. Our business is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors. Our investments generally range between $5 million and $100 million each, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or strategic initiatives. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of investments, which we refer to as opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall returns. These investments may include, but are not limited to, direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States. Our investment activities are managed by Solar Capital Partners, LLC (&#147;Solar Capital Partners&#148;) and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are non-interested, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act. Solar Capital Management, LLC (&#147;Solar Capital Management&#148;) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 

As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio totaled $1.3 billion and our net asset value was $882.7 million. Our portfolio was comprised of debt and equity investments in 54 portfolio companies with our portfolio of income producing investments having a weighted average annualized yield on a fair value and cost basis of approximately 10.5% and 10.2%, respectively. 

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we invested approximately $505 million of investments in 32 portfolio companies. Investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $171 million. 

Solar Capital Partners 

Solar Capital Partners, our investment adviser, is controlled and led by Michael S. Gross, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Bruce Spohler, our chief operating officer. They are supported by a team of dedicated investment professionals that have extensive experience in leveraged lending and private equity, as well as significant contacts with financial sponsors. 

In addition, Solar Capital Partners serves as the investment adviser for Solar Senior Capital Ltd. (or &#147;Solar Senior&#148;), a publicly traded business development company with approximately $435 million of investable capital that invests in the senior debt securities of leveraged middle market companies similar to those we intend to target for investment. Through December 31, 2015, the investment team led by Messrs. Gross and Spohler has invested approximately $5.4 billion in more than 215 different portfolio companies involving an aggregate of more than 135 different financial sponsors. As of February 23, 2016, Mr. Gross and Mr. Spohler beneficially owned, either directly or indirectly, approximately 5.6% and 5.1%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. 

&#160; 

Solar Capital Management 

Pursuant to an administration agreement (the &#147;Administration Agreement&#148;), Solar Capital Management furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, Solar Capital Management also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders. In addition, Solar Capital Management assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Solar Capital Management also provides managerial assistance, if any, on our behalf to those portfolio companies that request such assistance. 

Investments 

Solar Capital seeks to create a diverse portfolio that includes senior secured loans, mezzanine loans and equity securities by investing approximately $5 million to $100 million of capital, on average, in the securities of leveraged companies, including middle-market companies. We expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or for strategic initiatives. Structurally, mezzanine loans usually rank subordinate in priority of payment to senior debt, such as senior bank debt, and are often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. However, mezzanine loans rank senior to common and preferred equity in a borrowers&#146; capital structure. Mezzanine loans may have both elements of debt and equity instruments, offering fixed returns in the form of interest payments associated with senior debt, while providing lenders an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation of a borrower, if any, through an equity interest. This equity interest may take the form of warrants. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to senior loans, mezzanine loans generally earn a higher return than senior secured loans. The warrants associated with mezzanine loans, if any, are typically detachable, which may allow for lenders to receive repayment of their principal on an agreed amortization schedule while retaining their equity interest in the borrower. Mezzanine loans also may include a &#147;put&#148; feature, which permits the holder to sell its equity interest back to the borrower at a price determined through an agreed formula. We believe that mezzanine loans have historically offered an attractive investment opportunity based upon their returns and resilience during economic downturns. 

In addition to senior secured loans and mezzanine loans, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus, but are intended to enhance our returns to our investors. These investments may include direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States. The securities that we invest in are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as &#147;leveraged loans,&#148; &#147;high yield&#148; or &#147;junk&#148; securities, and may be considered &#147;high risk&#148; compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade. In addition, many of our debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which could result in a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. We may invest up to 30% of our total assets in such opportunistic investments, including senior loans issued by non-U.S. issuers, subject to compliance with our regulatory obligations as a business development company under the 1940 Act. 

We may borrow funds to make investments. As a result, we will be exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. The use of leverage magnifies the potential for loss on amounts invested and therefore increases the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in management fees payable to our investment adviser, Solar Capital Partners, will be borne by our common stockholders. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we may create a wholly or partially owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. This could include the sale of interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers who we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate to invest in investment grade loan pools, and we would retain a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. 

Moreover, we may acquire investments in the secondary market and, in analyzing such investments, we expect to employ a similar analytical process as we use for our primary investments. 

We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. It may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge partially, fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not entirely related to currency fluctuations. 

Our principal focus is to provide senior secured loans and mezzanine loans to leveraged companies in a variety of industries. We generally seek to target companies that generate positive cash flows. We generally seek to invest in companies from the broad variety of industries in which our investment adviser has direct expertise.

We may also invest in other industries if we are presented with attractive opportunities. 

We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds. We may also participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, each of whose investment adviser is Solar Capital Partners, or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Solar Capital Partners, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the exemptive order obtained from the SEC on July 28, 2014. 

At December 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of 54 portfolio companies and was invested 63.7% in senior secured loans, 5.1% in subordinated debt, 1.4% in preferred equity and 29.8% in common equity and warrants (of which 22.1% is Crystal Financial LLC and 6.1% is Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program LLC), in each case, measured at fair value. We expect that our portfolio will continue to include primarily senior secured and mezzanine loans as well as, to a lesser extent, equity-related securities. In addition, we also expect to invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus, but are intended to enhance our risk-adjusted returns to stockholders. These investments may include, but are not limited to, securities of public companies and debt and equity securities of companies located outside of the United States. 

While our primary investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through investments in U.S. senior and subordinated loans, other debt securities and equity, we may also invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments, including foreign securities.

&#160; Investment Selection Process 

Solar Capital Partners is committed to and utilizes a value-oriented investment philosophy with a focus on the preservation of capital and a commitment to managing downside exposure. 

Portfolio Company Characteristics 

We have identified several criteria that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. 

Stable Earnings and Strong Free Cash Flow. We seek to invest in companies who have demonstrated stable earnings through economic cycles. We target companies that can de-lever through consistent generation of cash flows rather than relying solely on growth to service and repay our loans. 

&#160; 

Value Orientation. Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis from an investor&#146;s perspective and has a distinct value orientation. We focus on companies in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of operating cash flow and that are profitable at the time of investment on an operating cash flow basis. 

Value of Assets. The prospective value of the assets, if any, that collateralizes the loans in which we invest, is an important factor in our credit analysis. Our analysis emphasizes both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases. In some of our transactions the portfolio company&#146;s fundings may be derived from a borrowing base determined by the value of such company&#146;s assets. 

Strong Competitive Position in Industry. We seek to invest in target companies that have developed leading market positions within their respective markets and are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. We seek companies that demonstrate significant competitive advantages versus their competitors, which we believe should help to protect their market position and profitability. 

Diversified Customer and Supplier Base. We seek to invest in businesses that have a diversified customer and supplier base. We believe that companies with a diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure economic downturns, industry consolidation, changing business preferences and other factors that may negatively impact their customers, suppliers and competitors. 

Exit Strategy. We predominantly invest in companies which provide multiple alternatives for an eventual exit. We look for opportunities that provide an exit typically within three years of the initial capital commitment. 

We generally seek companies that we believe will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans and reinvest in their respective businesses. We believe that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of our interest, and the repayment of our principal, represent a key means by which we will be able to exit from our investments over time. 

In addition, we also seek to invest in companies whose business models or expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock or another capital market transaction. We generally underwrite our investments on a held-to-maturity basis, but expensive capital is often repaid prior to stated maturity. 

Experienced and Committed Management. We generally require that portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also require portfolio companies have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity interests. 

Strong Sponsorship. We generally aim to invest alongside other sophisticated investors. We typically seek to partner with successful financial sponsors who have historically generated high returns. We believe that investing in these sponsors&#146; portfolio companies enables us to benefit from their direct involvement and due diligence. 

Solar Capital&#146;s investment team works in concert with sponsors to proactively manage investment opportunities by acting as a partner throughout the investment process. We actively focus on the middle-market financial sponsor community, with a particular focus on the upper-end of the middle-market (generally sponsors with equity funds of $800 million to $3 billion). We favor such sponsors because they typically: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; buy larger companies with strong business franchises; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest significant amounts of equity in their portfolio companies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; value flexibility and creativity in structuring their transactions; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; possess longer track records over multiple investment funds; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; have a deeper management bench; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; have better ability to withstand downturns; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; possess the ability to support portfolio companies with additional capital. 

We divide our coverage of these sponsors among our more senior investment professionals, who are responsible for day-to-day interaction with financial sponsors. Our coverage approach aims to act proactively, consider all investments in the capital structure, provide quick feedback, deliver on commitments, and are constructive throughout the life cycle of an investment. 

Due Diligence 

Our &#147;private equity&#148; approach to credit investing typically incorporates extensive in-depth due diligence often alongside the private equity sponsor. In conducting due diligence, we will use publicly available information as well as information from relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers. We believe that our due diligence methodology allows us to screen a high volume of potential investment opportunities on a consistent and thorough basis. 

Our due diligence typically includes: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; review of historical and prospective financial information; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; review and valuation of assets; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; research relating to the company&#146;s management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; on-site visits; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; discussions with management, employees, customers or vendors of the potential portfolio company; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; review of senior loan documents; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; background investigations. 

We also expect to evaluate the private equity sponsor making the investment. Further, due to Solar Capital Partners&#146; considerable repeat business with sponsors, we have direct experience with the management teams of many sponsors. A private equity sponsor is typically the controlling shareholder upon completion of an investment and as such is considered critical to the success of the investment. The equity sponsor is evaluated along several key criteria, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; investment track record; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; industry experience; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; capacity and willingness to provide additional financial support to the company through additional capital contributions, if necessary; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reference checks. 

Throughout the due diligence process, a deal team is in constant dialogue with the management team of the company in which we are considering to invest to ensure that any concerns are addressed as early as possible through the process and that unsuitable investments are filtered out before considerable time has been invested. 

Upon the completion of due diligence and a decision to proceed with an investment in a company, the investment professionals leading the investment present the investment opportunity to Solar Capital Partners&#146; 

&#160; 

investment committee, which then determine whether to pursue the potential investment. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and independent accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate. 

The Investment Committee 

All new investments are required to be approved by a consensus of the investment committee of Solar Capital Partners, which is led by Messrs. Gross and Spohler. The members of Solar Capital Partners&#146; investment committee receive no compensation from us. Such members may be employees or partners of Solar Capital Partners and may receive compensation or profit distributions from Solar Capital Partners. 

Investment Structure 

Once we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other capital in the portfolio company&#146;s capital structure. 

We invest in portfolio companies in the form of senior secured loans. We seek to obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. 

We structure our mezzanine investments primarily as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed or floating interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to the later years of the mezzanine loans. In some cases, we may enter into loans that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases our mezzanine loans may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. Typically, our mezzanine loans have maturities of five to ten years. 

Typically, our senior secured and mezzanine loans have final maturities of five to ten years. However, we expect that our portfolio companies often may repay these loans early, generally within two to four years from the date of initial investment. To preserve an acceptable return on investment, we seek to structure these loans with prepayment premiums. 

In the case of our senior secured and mezzanine loan investments, we tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior or fulcrum position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we will seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential capital appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; incorporating &#147;put&#148; rights and call protection into the investment structure; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights. 

Our investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return 

&#160; 

from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity securities, which may include demand and &#147;piggyback&#148; registration rights. In addition, we may from time to time make direct equity investments in portfolio companies. 

We generally seek to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but may attempt to sell our investments earlier, including if a liquidity event takes place such as the sale or recapitalization of a portfolio company. 

Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies 

Solar Capital Partners monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Solar Capital Partners monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. 

Solar Capital Partners has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Assessment of success in adhering to each portfolio company&#146;s business plan and compliance with covenants; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Comparisons to other Solar Capital portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Solar Capital Partners also uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. 

We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the weighted average investment rating on the fair market value of our portfolio was a 2. In connection with our valuation process, Solar Capital Partners reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. 

&#160; 

Valuation Procedures 

We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value is determined, at all times consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;), and the 1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: 

Under procedures established by our board of directors (the &#147;Board&#148;), we value investments, including certain senior secured debt, subordinated debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). We attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative. If and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, we typically utilize independent third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step valuation process as described below. In each case, our independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations. Debt investments with maturities of 60 days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of Solar Capital Partners, does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board. Such determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

&#160;

&#160; (1) our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of Solar Capital Partners responsible for the portfolio investment; &#160;

&#160; (2) preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of Solar Capital Partners; &#160;

&#160; (3) independent valuation firms engaged by our Board conduct independent appraisals and review Solar Capital Partners&#146;s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment for all material assets; &#160;

&#160; (4) the audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuation of Solar Capital Partners and that of the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments; and &#160;

&#160; (5) the Board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of Solar Capital Partners, the respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee. Investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company&#146;s 

&#160; 

ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M&#38;A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, there has been no change to the Company&#146;s valuation techniques and the nature of the related inputs considered in the valuation process. 

Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy: 

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Company at the measurement date. 

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 

In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The exercise of judgment is based in part on our knowledge of the asset class and our prior experience. 

Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements. 

Competition 

Our primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, frequently invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies can be intense. However, we continue to believe that there has been an overall reduction in the amount of debt capital available on average since the downturn in the credit markets, which began in mid-2007, and that this has resulted in a somewhat less competitive environment for making new investments. While many middle-market companies were previously able to raise senior debt financing through traditional large financial institutions, we believe this approach to financing is more difficult as implementation of U.S. and international financial reforms, such as Basel 3, limits the capacity of large financial institutions to hold non-investment grade leveraged loans on their balance sheets. We believe that many of these financial institutions have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market companies in particular. 

Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company. We use the industry information available to Messrs. Gross and Spohler and the other investment professionals of Solar Capital Partners to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the relationships of Messrs. Gross and Spohler and the other senior investment professionals of our investment adviser enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive leveraged companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. 

&#160; 

Staffing 

We do not currently have any employees. Mr. Gross, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Mr. Spohler, our chief operating officer, currently serve as the managing member and partner, respectively, of our investment adviser, Solar Capital Partners. Richard Peteka, our chief financial officer and corporate secretary, is an officer and employee of Solar Capital Management, and performs his functions as chief financial officer under the terms of our Administration Agreement. Guy Talarico, our chief compliance officer, is the chief executive officer of Alaric Compliance Services, LLC, and performs his functions as our chief compliance officer under the terms of an agreement between Solar Capital Management and Alaric Compliance Services, LLC. Solar Capital Management has retained Mr. Talarico and Alaric Compliance Services, LLC pursuant to its obligations under our Administration Agreement. 

Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by Solar Capital Partners. Based upon its needs, Solar Capital Partners may hire additional investment professionals. In addition, we will reimburse Solar Capital Management for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of the Company&#146;s chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the 1934 Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the consolidated financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

Business Development Company Regulations 

A BDC is regulated by the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. 

We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% 

&#160; 

or more of such company&#146;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 

As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

As a BDC, we are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, reflecting the value of our total assets to our total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). 

We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share without annual shareholder approval. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 11, 2015, our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to sell up to 25% of our common stock at a price below our then-current asset value per share, subject to the approval by our board of directors for the offering. This authorization expires on the earlier of June 11, 2016 and the date of our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be held in June 2016. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 

As a BDC, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which our investment adviser or any of its affiliates currently have an investment or to make any co-investments with our investment adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. 

We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

&#160;

&#160; (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 

&#160; 

(c) satisfies any of the following: 

i.) does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; 

ii.) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; 

iii.) is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or 

iv.) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million. 

&#160;

&#160; (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control, which, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. &#160;

&#160; (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. &#160;

&#160; (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. &#160;

&#160; (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. &#160;

&#160; (6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. &#160;

&#160; (7) Office furniture and equipment, interests in real estate and leasehold improvements and facilities maintained to conduct the business operations of the business development company, deferred organization and operating expenses, and other noninvestment assets necessary and appropriate to its operations as a business development company, including notes of indebtedness of directors, officers, employees, and general partners held by a business development company as payment for securities of such company issued in connection with an executive compensation plan described in Section 57(j) of the 1940 Act. Under Section 55(b) of the 1940 Act, the value of a BDC&#146;s assets shall be determined as of the date of the most recent financial statements filed by such company with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;), and shall be determined no less frequently than annually. 

Significant Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may also receive fees for these services. Solar Capital Management provides such managerial assistance, if any, on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality investment grade debt securities maturing in 

&#160; 

one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, provided that such repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies, or other high-quality, short-term debt securities. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our investment adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. We may borrow money, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. 

Code of Ethics 

We and Solar Capital Partners have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;), respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our codes of ethics generally do not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. You may read and copy these codes of ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1 (800) SEC-0330. In addition, each code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#146;s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of the codes of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following Email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

We and our investment adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws. We are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and to designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for their administration. Guy Talarico currently serves as our chief compliance officer. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our investment adviser. A summary of the Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

As an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Solar Capital Partners has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote 

&#160; 

securities held by its clients in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Our investment adviser votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interest of our stockholders. Solar Capital Partners reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a proxy vote to determine its impact on our investments. Although it generally votes against proposals that may have a negative impact on our investments, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. The proxy voting decisions of our investment adviser are made by the senior investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to a managing member of Solar Capital Partners any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Solar Capital Partners, LLC, 500 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022. 

Privacy Principles 

We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders (or former stockholders) to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator). 

We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our investment adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 

Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 

As a BDC, we elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). If we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed not distributed) to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, in preceding years (the &#147;Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement&#148;). 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; at all times during each taxable year, have in effect an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or currencies, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and (b) net income derived from an interest in a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership;&#148; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (ii) the securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) the securities of one or more &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships.&#148; 

The Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, which was generally effective for 2011 and subsequent tax years, provides some relief from RIC disqualification due to failures of the income and asset diversification requirements, although there may be additional taxes due in such cases. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind (&#147;PIK&#148;) interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

Because we may use debt financing, we will be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources or are otherwise limited in our ability to make distributions, we could fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (v) adversely affect 

&#160; 

the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% gross income test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions. 

Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term will depend on how long we held a particular warrant. Upon the exercise of a warrant acquired by us, our tax basis in the stock purchased under the warrant will equal the sum of the amount paid for the warrant plus the strike price paid on the exercise of the warrant. 

Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company 

If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Such distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as dividends and, provided certain holding period and other requirements were met, could qualify for treatment as &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; in the hands of non-corporate stockholders (and thus eligible for a reduced tax rate) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate shareholders would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To re-qualify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that re-qualify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent 10 years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC. 

Investment Advisory Fees 

Pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement (the &#147;Advisory Agreement&#148;), we have agreed to pay Solar Capital Partners a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components &#151; a base management fee and an incentive fee. 

The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets. For services rendered under the Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. 

The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to Solar Capital Management, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay in kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, 

&#160; 

computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2.00% base management fee. We pay Solar Capital Partners an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of 1.75%; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.1875%) as the &#147;catch-up.&#148; The &#147;catch-up&#148; is meant to provide our investment adviser with 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) is payable to Solar Capital Partners (once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to Solar Capital Partners). 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 

Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

&#160;

&#160;

allocated to Solar Capital Partners 

These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income. 

The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio.

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 

Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*): 

Alternative 1: 

Assumptions 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75% 

Management fee (2) = 0.50% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55% 

Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. 

Alternative 2: 

Assumptions 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70% 

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75% 

Management fee (2) = 0.50% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.00% 

Incentive fee = 100% &#215; pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to the &#147;catch-up&#148; (4) 

= 100% &#215; (2.00% &#150; 1.75%) 

= 0.25% 

Alternative 3: 

Assumptions 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.00% 

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75% 

Management fee (2) = 0.50% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% 

&#160; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.30% 

Incentive fee = 20% &#215; pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to &#147;catch-up&#148; (4) 

Incentive fee = 100% &#215; &#147;catch-up&#148; + (20% &#215; (pre-incentive fee net investment income &#150; 2.1875%)) 

Catch-up = 2.1875% &#150; 1.75% 

= 0.4375% 

Incentive fee = (100% &#215; 0.4375%) + (20% &#215; (2.3% &#150; 2.1875%)) 

= 0.4375% + (20% &#215; 0.1125%) 

= 0.4375% + 0.0225% 

= 0.46% 

&#160;

(*) The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. (1) Represents 7% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 2% annualized management fee. (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. (4) The &#147;catch-up&#148; provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee: 

Alternative 1: 

Assumptions 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (&#147;FMV&#148;) of Investment B determined to be $32 million 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million 

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 1: None 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 3: None 

$5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000 

$6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains fee taken in Year 2) 

&#160; 

Alternative 2: 

Assumptions 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#147;Investment C&#148;) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million 

The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 1: None 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee 

20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee (1) 

$6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains fee received in Year 2 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 4: None 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Year 5: None 

$5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3. 

&#160;

&#160; (1) As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 2 above, if Solar Capital were to be wound up on a date other than December 31 of any year, Solar Capital may have paid aggregate capital gain incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if Solar Capital had been wound up on December 31 of such year.
