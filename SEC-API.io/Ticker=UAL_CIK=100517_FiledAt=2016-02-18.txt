 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview 

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, &#147;UAL&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, &#147;United&#148;). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United&#146;s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL&#146;s revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL&#146;s assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; and the &#147;Company&#148; in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United. 

UAL was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 1968. Our world headquarters is located at 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 (telephone number (872) 825-4000). 

The Company&#146;s website is www.unitedcontinentalholdings.com. The information contained on or connected to the Company&#146;s website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). Through this website, the Company&#146;s filings with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, as well as our proxy statement for our annual meeting of stockholders, are accessible without charge as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Operations 

The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline and regional operations. See Part I, Item 2 Properties, for a description of the Company&#146;s mainline and regional aircraft. 

With key global air rights in North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, UAL has the world&#146;s most comprehensive global route network. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates an average of nearly 5,000 flights a day to 342 airports across six continents from the Company&#146;s hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport (&#147;Newark Liberty&#148;), Chicago O&#146;Hare International Airport (&#147;Chicago O&#146;Hare&#148;), Denver International Airport (&#147;Denver&#148;), George Bush Intercontinental Airport (&#147;Houston Bush&#148;), Los Angeles International Airport (&#147;LAX&#148;), A.B. Won Pat International Airport (&#147;Guam&#148;), San Francisco International Airport (&#147;SFO&#148;) and Washington Dulles International Airport (&#147;Washington Dulles&#148;). 

&#160; 

All of the Company&#146;s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers, contributing to a large amount of &#147;origin and destination&#148; traffic. The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the world&#146;s largest alliance network. 

Financial information on the Company&#146;s operating revenues by geographic regions, as reported to the U.S. Department of Transportation (the &#147;DOT&#148;), can be found in Note 17 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

Regional. The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as United Express. These regional operations are an extension of the Company&#146;s mainline network. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. Republic Airlines (&#147;Republic&#148;), CommutAir Airlines (&#147;CommutAir&#148;), ExpressJet Airlines (&#147;ExpressJet&#148;), GoJet Airlines (&#147;GoJet&#148;), Mesa Airlines (&#147;Mesa&#148;), Shuttle America (&#147;Shuttle&#148;), SkyWest Airlines (&#147;SkyWest&#148;) and Trans States Airlines (&#147;Trans States&#148;) are all regional carriers, which operate most of their capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (&#147;CPAs&#148;) with United. Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier-controlled costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics. The fees for carrier-controlled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures) while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees, facilities rent and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats, and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus loyalty program. 

While the regional carriers operating under CPAs comprise more than 95% of all regional flights, the Company also has prorate agreements with Hyannis Air Service, Inc. (&#147;Cape Air&#148;), SkyWest and Trans States. Under these commercial flying agreements, the Company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula, while both the Company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations. Unlike CPAs, under a prorate agreement, the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling, and in most cases, market selection, local seat pricing and inventory for its flights, although the Company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections. 

Alliances. United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network co-founded by United in 1997 and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2016, Star Alliance carriers served over 1,300 airports in more than 190 countries with over 18,500 daily departures. Current Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Adria Airways, Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways (&#147;ANA&#148;), Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Avianca, Avianca Brasil, Brussels Airlines, Copa Airlines, Croatia Airlines, EGYPTAIR, Ethiopian Airlines, EVA Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, SWISS, TAP Portugal, THAI Airways International and Turkish Airlines. 

United has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other things, reciprocal earning, redemption of frequent flyer miles and access to airport lounges and, with certain Star Alliance members, codesharing of flight operations (whereby one carrier&#146;s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers currently unaffiliated with a global alliance, including Aeromar, Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Azul, Cape Air, 

&#160; 

Eurowings, Germanwings, Great Lakes Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Island Air, Jet Airways and Silver Airways. United also offers a train-to-plane codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with Amtrak from Newark Liberty on select city pairs in the Northeastern United States. 

United also participates in joint ventures, one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its affiliates Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, and another with ANA covering certain transpacific routes. These joint ventures enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. 

Loyalty Program. United&#146;s MileagePlus program builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants. Members in this program earn mileage credit for flights on United, United Express, airlines in Star Alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of non-airline partners, such as credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels and car rental companies. Members can redeem mileage credits for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded travel and non-travel awards. 

The Company has an agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A. (&#147;Chase&#148;), pursuant to which members of the Company&#146;s MileagePlus &#174; loyalty program earn miles for making purchases using a MileagePlus &#174; credit card issued by Chase. The agreement also provides for joint marketing and other support for the MileagePlus &#174; credit card and provides Chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the Company&#146;s customer database. 

Approximately 5.0 million and 4.8 million MileagePlus flight awards were used on United in 2015 and 2014, respectively. These awards represented 7.5% and 7.1% of United&#146;s total revenue passenger miles in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total miles redeemed for flights on United in 2015, including class-of-service upgrades, represented approximately 83% of the total miles redeemed. 

In addition, excluding miles redeemed for flights on United, MileagePlus members redeemed miles for approximately 1.8 million other awards in 2015 as compared to 1.75 million in 2014. These awards include United Club memberships, car and hotel awards, merchandise and flights on other air carriers. 

Aircraft Fuel. The table below summarizes UAL&#146;s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years. 

&#160;

(a) Calculation excludes special charges identified in Note 16 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

The availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the Company&#146;s operations, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. To provide adequate supplies of fuel, the Company routinely enters into short-term and long-term purchase contracts that are generally indexed to floating market prices for aircraft fuel, and the Company has some ability to store fuel close to its major hub locations. To lower its exposure to unpredictable increases in the floating market prices of aircraft fuel, the Company may hedge a portion of its planned fuel requirements. The Company generally employs commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including diesel fuel and crude oil. 

Third-Party Business. United generates third-party business revenue that includes fuel sales, catering, ground handling, maintenance services and frequent flyer award non-air redemptions, and third-party business revenue is recorded in Other operating revenue. United also incurs third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties, fuel sales and non-air mileage redemptions, and those third-party business expenses are recorded in Other operating expenses. 

&#160; 

Distribution Channels. The Company&#146;s airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the Company&#146;s direct channels, traditional travel agencies and on-line travel agencies. The use of the Company&#146;s direct sales website, united.com, the Company&#146;s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems, provides the Company with an opportunity to de-commoditize its services, better present its content, make more targeted offerings, better retain its customers, enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs. Agency sales are primarily sold using global distribution systems (&#147;GDS&#148;). United has developed capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the GDS channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel. To increase the Company&#146;s opportunities to sell its full range of products and services and lower distribution costs, the Company will continue to develop new selling capabilities in third-party channels and expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications. 

Industry Conditions 

Domestic Competition. The domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic. The Company&#146;s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and, to a certain extent, other forms of transportation. Currently, any U.S. carrier deemed fit by the DOT is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the United States. Competition can be direct, in the form of another carrier flying the exact non-stop route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities non-stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. Air carriers&#146; cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure. Carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers, which could have a potential negative impact on the Company&#146;s revenues. Decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the Company by other U.S. airlines. In order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels, we often find it necessary to match competitors&#146; discounted fares. Since we compete in a dynamic marketplace, attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail. 

International Competition. Internationally, the Company competes not only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers. International competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances, restructurings, liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors, including government subsidized competitors from certain Middle East countries. Competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation. The Company&#146;s ability to compete successfully with non-U.S. carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire United States via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide. Foreign carriers currently are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local passengers between two points in the United States and the Company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries except where &#147;fifth freedom rights&#148; have been negotiated between the U.S. government and other countries. In addition, in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights, U.S. carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments. To compensate partially for these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into alliances, joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other&#146;s flights and route networks. See Alliances, above, for additional information. 

Seasonality. The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters, driving higher revenues, than in the first and fourth quarters, which are periods of lower travel demand. 

Industry Regulation 

Domestic Regulation 

All carriers engaged in air transportation in the United States are subject to regulation by the DOT. Absent an exemption, no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity. The DOT also grants international route authority, approves 

&#160; 

international codeshare arrangements, and regulates methods of competition. The DOT regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising, denied boarding compensation, tarmac delays, baggage liability and other areas, and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future. The DOT has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts. 

Airlines are also regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (the &#147;FAA&#148;), an agency within the DOT, primarily in the areas of flight safety, air carrier operations, and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness. The FAA issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates, prescribes maintenance procedures, oversees airport operations, and regulates pilot and other employee training. From time to time, the FAA issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment, potentially causing the Company to incur substantial, unplanned expenses. The airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (&#147;DHS&#148;) has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;) has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the Railway Labor Act (&#147;RLA&#148;), a federal statute. The Company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the DOT, FAA, DOJ, DHS and other U.S. and international regulatory bodies. 

Airport Access. Access to landing and take-off rights, or &#147;slots,&#148; at several major U.S. airports and many foreign airports served by the Company are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation. Federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at Reagan National Airport in Washington D.C., and at John F. Kennedy International Airport (&#147;JFK&#148;), LaGuardia Airport (&#147;LaGuardia&#148;) and Newark Liberty in the metropolitan New York region. In addition, to address concerns about airport congestion, the FAA has imposed operating restrictions at certain airports, including Newark Liberty, JFK, and LaGuardia, which may include capacity reductions. Additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be proposed in the future that could affect the Company&#146;s rights of ownership and transfer. In January 2015, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise and alter the current methods to manage congestion and delay at the New York area&#146;s three major commercial airports which may alter use of slots and congestion at those airports. 

Legislation. The airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs. In 2016, the U.S. Congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the FAA, which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy-related issues. As with previous reauthorization legislation, the U.S. Congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact operations and costs. Climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the Company&#146;s costs. See Environmental Regulation , below. 

Finally, aviation security continues to be the subject of legislative and regulatory action, requiring changes to the Company&#146;s security processes, increasing the cost of its security procedures, and affecting its operations. 

International Regulation 

International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In connection with the Company&#146;s international services, the Company is regulated by both the U.S. government and the governments of the foreign countries the Company serves. In addition, the availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. 

Legislation. Foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws, rules and regulations that meet or exceed U.S. requirements. In cases where this activity exceeds U.S. requirements, additional burden and liability may be placed on the Company. Certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation and/or enforcement penalties from the Company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights. 

&#160; 

Airport Access. Historically, access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the U.S. and each foreign country involved. These agreements regulate the markets served, the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers&#146; flights. Since the early 1990s, the U.S. has pursued a policy of &#147;open skies&#148; (meaning all U.S.-flag carriers have access to the destination), under which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between U.S. and foreign markets. Currently, there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect. However, many of the airports that the Company serves in Europe, Asia and Latin America maintain slot controls. A large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports. London Heathrow International Airport, Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport, Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Beijing Capital International Airport, Sao Paulo Guarulhos International Airport and Tokyo Haneda International Airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations. 

The Company&#146;s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the U.S. government and the relevant foreign governments. Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements. Depending on the nature of any such change, the value of the Company&#146;s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished. 

Environmental Regulation 

The airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international environmental requirements, including emissions to air, water discharges, safe drinking water, and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes. 

Climate Change . There is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas (&#147;GHG&#148;) emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change. Initiatives to regulate GHG emissions from aviation have been underway in the European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) since 2009 but applicability to flights arriving or departing from airports outside the EU was postponed to provide the International Civil Aviation Organization (&#147;ICAO&#148;) the opportunity to reach agreement on a global approach for international aviation. ICAO is expected to reach a resolution in 2016 advancing a global market-based measure for international aviation emissions starting in 2021. Separately, in 2016 ICAO is expected to adopt a carbon dioxide (&#147;CO2&#148;) standard for aircraft and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has already started the process required to adopt such an aircraft standard. In consideration of these future requirements, the Company is taking various actions that will help to reduce its CO2 emissions such as fleet renewal, aircraft retrofits and seeking to stimulate the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels. 

Other Regulations . Our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally. These include noise-related restrictions on aircraft types and operating times, which have or could in the future result in curtailments in services, increased operating costs or limits on expansion. Certain foreign airports and/or governments either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees applicable to carbon emissions, local air quality pollutants and/or noise. In the United States, new regulations affecting storm water and underground storage tanks became effective in 2015, which could affect airport fuel hydrant systems or airport storm water management, potentially impacting operating costs. Also, in October 2015, a final rule to reduce the national ambient air quality standards for ozone was issued which, if upheld, is expected to trigger restrictions on mobile sources such as cars, trucks, and airport ground support equipment in certain jurisdictions. Finally, environmental cleanup laws can require the Company to undertake or subject the Company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at owned or leased locations or third party disposal locations. 

Until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined, or in the case of the referenced GHG and ozone standards, these implementation measures are actually developed, future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain. While we continue to monitor these developments, we do not currently believe that such developments or resulting expenditures will have a material impact on our capital expenditures or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations, operating costs or competitive position. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, UAL, including its subsidiaries, had approximately 84,000 employees. Approximately 80% of the Company&#146;s employees were represented by various U.S. labor organizations as of December 31, 2015. 

Collective bargaining agreements between the Company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the RLA. Such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date, upon which the contract is considered &#147;open for amendment.&#148; The Company has reached joint collective bargaining agreements with the majority of its employee groups since the merger transaction in 2010. The Company continues to negotiate in mediation for a joint flight attendant collective bargaining agreement, extensions to the IAM represented employees&#146; agreements and a joint technician and related employees&#146; collective bargaining agreement following the rejected proposal for ratification of a joint technician and related employees&#146; agreement. The Company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of these labor negotiations will be achieved.
