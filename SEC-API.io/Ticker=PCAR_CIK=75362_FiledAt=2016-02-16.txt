(b) Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas Information about the Company&#146;s industry segments and geographic areas in response to Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i), and (d) of Regulation S-K appears in Item 8, Note R, of this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

(c) Narrative Description of Business PACCAR is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments: 

&#160;

&#160; (1) The Truck segment includes the design, manufacture and distribution of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. Heavy-duty trucks have a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of over 33,000 lbs (Class 8) in North America and over 16 metric tonnes in Europe. Medium-duty trucks have a GVW ranging from 19,500 to 33,000 lbs (Class 6 to 7) in North America, and in Europe, light- and medium-duty trucks range between 6 to 16 metric tonnes. Trucks are configured with engine in front of cab (conventional) or cab-over-engine (COE). &#160;

&#160; (2) The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. &#160;

&#160; (3) The Financial Services segment includes finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers. PACCAR&#146;s finance and leasing activities are principally related to PACCAR products and associated equipment. PACCAR&#146;s Other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches. 

TRUCKS 

PACCAR&#146;s trucks are marketed under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. These trucks, which are built in three plants in the United States, three in Europe and one each in Australia, Brasil, Canada and Mexico, are used worldwide for over-the-road and off-highway hauling of freight, petroleum, wood products and construction-related and other materials. The Company also manufactures engines at its facilities in Columbus, Mississippi and Eindhoven, the Netherlands. PACCAR competes in the North American Class 8 market, primarily with Kenworth and Peterbilt conventional models. These trucks are assembled at facilities in Chillicothe, Ohio, Denton, Texas, Renton, Washington, Ste. Therese, Canada and Mexicali, Mexico. PACCAR also competes in the North American Class 6 to 7 markets primarily with Kenworth and Peterbilt conventional models. These trucks are assembled at facilities in Ste. Therese, Canada and in Mexicali, Mexico. PACCAR competes in the European light/medium market with DAF COE trucks assembled in the United Kingdom by Leyland, one of PACCAR&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries, and participates in the European heavy market with DAF COE trucks assembled in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. PACCAR competes in the Brazilian heavy truck market with DAF models assembled at Ponta Grossa in the state of Paran&#225;, Brasil. PACCAR competes in the Australian light and heavy truck markets with Kenworth conventional and COE models assembled at its facility at Bayswater in the state of Victoria, Australia, and DAF COE models assembled in the Netherlands. Commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of PACCAR&#146;s business and accounts for 77% of total 2015 net sales and revenues. 

Substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers. The Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the U.S. and a foreign subsidiary in Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia. The DAF nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the Netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in Brasil and Australia. The decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to PACCAR&#146;s Truck segment operations and reflects legal, tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where PACCAR operates. 

&#160; 

The Truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing, information technology, technical research and testing, treasury and finance functions. Some manufacturing plants in North America produce trucks for more than one nameplate, while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate, depending on various factors. Best manufacturing practices within the Company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate. 

The Company&#146;s trucks have a reputation for high quality and are essentially custom products, most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specification. Some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies. For a significant portion of the Company&#146;s truck operations, major components, such as engines, transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of other components, are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR and customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically integrated, manufactures PACCAR engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models. The Company also manufactures engines at its Columbus, Mississippi facility. In 2015, the Company installed PACCAR engines in 40% of the Company&#146;s Kenworth and Peterbilt heavy-duty trucks in the U.S. and Canada. Engines not manufactured by the Company are purchased from Cummins Inc. (Cummins). The Company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from Eaton Corporation Plc. (Eaton) and ZF Friedrichshafen AG (ZF). The Company has long-term agreements with Cummins, Eaton and ZF to provide for continuity of supply. A loss of supply from Cummins, Eaton or ZF, and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks, would have a material effect on the Company&#146;s results. Purchased materials and parts include raw materials, partially processed materials, such as castings, and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers. Raw materials, partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 85% of the cost of new trucks. The value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 35% in Europe to approximately 85% in North America. In addition to materials, the Company&#146;s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead, vehicle delivery and warranty. Accordingly, except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation, property taxes and utilities, the Company&#146;s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales. 

The Company&#146;s DAF subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor, Renault V.I., for its European light-duty product line pursuant to a joint product development and long-term supply contract. Sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3% of consolidated revenues in 2015. A short-term loss of supply, and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks, would not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations. However, a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require the Company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself. 

Other than these components, the Company is not limited to any single source for any significant component, although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products. No significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2015. Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules, and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly. 

Key factors affecting Truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales. The Company&#146;s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the Company&#146;s share of those markets. Truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity, the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported. The Company&#146;s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs, which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and petroleum. The Company utilizes long-term supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components. The Company&#146;s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as the periodic need to meet diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served. The Company maintains rigorous control of selling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses and seeks to minimize such costs. 

There are four principal competitors in the U.S. and Canada commercial truck market. The Company&#146;s share of the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 market was 27.4% of retail sales in 2015, and the Company&#146;s medium-duty market share was 17.4% in 2015. In Europe, there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market, including parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the U.S. In 2015, DAF had a 14.6% share of the Western and Central European heavy-duty market and a 9.0% share of the light/medium market. These markets are highly competitive in price, quality and service. PACCAR is not dependent on any single customer for its sales. There are no significant seasonal variations in sales. 

&#160; 

The Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the Company&#146;s truck products. The Company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world. 

The Company&#146;s truck products are subject to noise, emission and safety regulations. Competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations. The Company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be detrimental to its business. 

The Company had a total production backlog of $5.9 billion at the end of 2015. Within this backlog, orders scheduled for delivery within three months (90 days) are considered to be firm. The 90-day backlog approximated $2.8 billion at December 31, 2015, $3.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2013. Production of the year-end 2015 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2016. 

PARTS 

The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2,000 Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers in over 90 countries around the world. Aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the Company&#146;s independent dealers through the Company&#146;s 17 strategically located parts distribution centers (PDCs) located in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Mexico and South America. Parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the Company. Aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery. The Parts segment accounted for 16% of total 2015 net sales and revenues. 

PACCAR&#146;s new 160,000 square-foot PDC in Renton, Washington is under construction and is expected to open in the second quarter of 2016. The new facility will increase the distribution capacity for the Company&#146;s dealers and customers in the northwestern U.S. and western Canada. 

Key factors affecting Parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales. Aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the Company&#146;s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks. To reflect the benefit the Parts segment receives from costs incurred by the Truck segment, certain factory overhead, research and development, engineering and SG&#38;A expenses are allocated from the Truck segment to the Parts segment. The Company&#146;s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs, which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and petroleum. The Company utilizes long-term supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold. The Company maintains rigorous control of SG&#38;A expenses and seeks to minimize such costs. 

FINANCIAL SERVICES 

PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) operates in 22 countries in North America, Europe, Australia and South America through wholly owned finance companies operating under the PACCAR Financial trade name. PFS also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in North America, Germany and Australia under the PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to provide full service leasing. PFS provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support. PFS also operates its own full service lease outlets. PFS&#146;s retail loan and lease customers consist of small, medium and large commercial trucking companies, independent owner/operators and other businesses and acquire their PACCAR trucks principally from independent PACCAR dealers. PFS accounted for 6% of total net sales and revenues and 58% of total assets in 2015. 

The Company&#146;s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale, dealer retail and customer retail segments. The dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent PACCAR dealers. The dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises, which use the proceeds to fund their customers&#146; acquisition of trucks and related equipment. The customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment. Customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owner/operator classes. The fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks. All others are considered owner/operators. Similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class. 

Finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased. The terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment. Payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan, whichever comes first. Dealer inventory loans generally mature within one to two years. 

&#160; 

The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in public and private offerings and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. An additional source of funds is loans from other PACCAR companies. PFS attempts to match the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases. 

Key factors affecting the earnings of the Financial Services segment include the volume of new loans and leases, the yield earned on the loans and leases, the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to PFS. New loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the Financial Services segment. The Company&#146;s Financial Services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market. PFS&#146;s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies. 

The revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of PFS to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service. Dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market. Retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term. PFS obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings, a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest-rate contracts. This enables PFS to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term. Included in Financial Services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases. The amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment, the term of the leases, which generally ranges from three to five years, and the residual value of the leases, which generally ranges from 30% to 50%. The margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation, including interest and depreciation. 

PFS incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts. PFS takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses. 

The ability of customers to pay their obligations to PFS depends on the state of the general economy, the extent of freight demand, freight rates and the cost of fuel, among other factors. PFS limits its exposure to any one customer, with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5% of the aggregate portfolio assets. PFS generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees. In the event of default, PFS will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network. PFS will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral. The amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and, in the event of repossession, the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices. PFS&#146;s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession. Used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness. As a result, credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness. PFS provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio, considering the amount of past due accounts, the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets. 

Financial Services SG&#38;A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios. These costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity, but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities, tend to be relatively stable. 

OTHER BUSINESSES 

Other businesses include a division of the Company which manufactures industrial winches in two U.S. plants and markets them under the Braden, Carco and Gearmatic nameplates. The markets for these products are highly competitive, and the Company competes with a number of well established firms. Sales of industrial winches were less than 1% of total net sales and revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

The Braden, Carco and Gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products. 

&#160; 

PATENTS 

The Company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines. Although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the Company&#146;s business, no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the Company&#146;s business.
