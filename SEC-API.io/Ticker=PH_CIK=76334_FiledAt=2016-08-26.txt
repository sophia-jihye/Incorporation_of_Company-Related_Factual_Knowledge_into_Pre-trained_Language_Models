Competition 

The Company&#8217;s business operates in highly competitive markets and industries. The Company offers its products over numerous, varied markets through its divisions operating in 49 &#32;countries and consequently has hundreds of competitors when viewed across its various markets and product offerings. The Company&#8217;s competitors include U.S. and non-U.S. companies. These competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by product lines, end markets, geographic scope and/or geographic locations. Although each of the Company&#8217;s segments has numerous competitors, given the Company&#8217;s market and product breadth, no single competitor competes with the Company with respect to all products manufactured and sold by the Company. 

In the Diversified Industrial Segment, the Company competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. The Company believes that it is one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for its most significant Diversified Industrial Segment products. The Company has comprehensive motion and control packages for the broadest systems capabilities. While the Company&#8217;s primary global competitors include Bosch Rexroth AG, Danaher Corporation, Danfoss A/S, Donaldson Company, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, Emerson Climate Technologies, Emerson/ASCO, Festo AG, Freudenberg-NOK, Gates Corporation, IMI/Norgren, SMC Corporation, Swagelok Company, and Trelleborg AB, none of these businesses compete with every group in the Company's Diversified Industrial Segment and every product line offered by this segment. 

In the Aerospace Systems Segment, the Company has developed alliances with key customers based on the Company&#8217;s advanced technological and engineering capabilities, superior performance in quality, delivery, and service, and price competitiveness, which has enabled the Company to obtain significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for its systems and components and to thereby obtain the follow-on repair and replacement business for these programs. Further, the Aerospace Systems Segment is able to utilize low-cost manufacturing techniques for similar products in the Diversified Industrial Segment to achieve a lower cost producer status. Although the Company believes that it is one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for its most significant Aerospace Systems Segment products, the Company&#8217;s primary global competitors for the most significant Aerospace Systems Segment products include Eaton Corporation plc, Honeywell International, Inc., Moog Inc., Triumph Group, Inc., UTC Aerospace Systems, Woodward, Inc. and Zodiac Aerospace SA. 

The Company believes that its platform utilizing nine core technologies, which consist of aerospace, electromechanical, filtration, fluid handling, hydraulics, pneumatics, process control, refrigeration, and sealing and shielding, is a positive factor in its ability to compete effectively with both large and small competitors. For both of its segments, the Company believes that the following factors also contribute to its ability to compete effectively: 

&#8226; 

decentralized operating structure that allows each division to focus on its customers and respond quickly at the local level; 

&#8226; 

systems solution capabilities that use the Company&#8217;s core technologies from both of its segments; 

&#8226; 

global presence; and 

&#8226; 

a strong global distribution network. 

Research and Product Development 

The Company continually researches the feasibility of new products and services through its development laboratories and testing facilities in many of its worldwide manufacturing locations. Its research and product development staff includes chemists, physicists, and mechanical, chemical and electrical engineers. 

Total research and development costs relating to the development of new products and services and the improvement of existing products and services amounted to $359.8 million &#32;in 2016 , $403.1 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;and $410.1 million &#32;in 2014 . These amounts include costs incurred by the Company related to independent research and development initiatives as well as costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts. Costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts and included in the total research and development costs reported above for 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were $58.0 million , $57.8 million &#32;and $55.9 million , respectively. 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses 

The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use a number of patents owned by others. In addition, patent applications on certain products are now pending, although there can be no assurance that patents will be issued. The Company is not dependent to any material extent on any single patent, trademark or license or group of patents, trademarks or licenses. 

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business 

Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. The Company's backlog by business segment for the past two years is included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company&#8217;s backlog was $3.2 billion &#32;at June 30, 2016 &#32;and $3.3 billion &#32;at June 30, 2015 . Approximately 86% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s backlog at June 30, 2016 &#32;is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The Company&#8217;s business is generally not seasonal in nature. 

Environmental Regulation 

Certain of the Company&#8217;s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, the Company is subject to United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposures to, hazardous materials. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the United States federal "Superfund" law, under which the Company has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Superfund priority list. 

As of June 30, 2016 , the Company was involved in environmental remediation at various United States and non-U.S. manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and as a "potentially responsible party," along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites. 

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company. 

As of June 30, 2016 , the Company had a reserve of $15.2 million &#32;for environmental matters that were probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve was recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Company&#8217;s liability in proportion to other responsible parties. 

The Company&#8217;s estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of $15.2 million &#32;to a maximum of $80.6 million . The largest range of the estimated total liability for any one site is approximately $7.6 million . The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of the other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries. 

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The Company&#8217;s primary energy source for both of its business segments is electric power. While the Company cannot predict future costs of electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven coal reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments. 

Steel, brass, copper, aluminum, nickel, rubber and thermoplastic materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the Company. These materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company. 

Employees 

The Company employed approximately 48,950 &#32;persons as of June 30, 2016 , of whom approximately 26,280 &#32;were employed by foreign subsidiaries. 

Business Segment Information 

The Company&#8217;s net sales, segment operating income and assets by business segment and net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area for the past three years are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
