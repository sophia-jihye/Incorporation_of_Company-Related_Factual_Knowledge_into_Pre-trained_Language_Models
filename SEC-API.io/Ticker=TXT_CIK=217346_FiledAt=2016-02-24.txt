Bell supplies advanced military helicopters and support to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside the United States. Bell&#146;s primary U.S. Government programs are the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopters. Bell is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the U.S. Government and, in association with The Boeing Company (Boeing), the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Through its strategic alliance with Boeing, Bell produces and supports the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and recently entered into its first contract to sell the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft under the U.S. Government sponsored foreign military sales program. The U.S. Marine Corps H-1 helicopter program includes a utility model, the UH-1Y, and an advanced attack model, the AH-1Z, which have 84% parts commonality between them. 

&#160; 

Through its commercial business, Bell is a leading supplier of commercially certified helicopters and support to corporate, offshore petroleum exploration and development, utility, charter, police, fire, rescue, emergency medical helicopter operators and foreign governments. Bell produces a variety of commercial aircraft types, including light single- and twin-engine helicopters and medium twin-engine helicopters, along with other related products. The helicopters currently offered by Bell for commercial applications include the 206L-4, 407, 407GT, 407GXP, 412EP, 412EPI, 429 and Huey II. The new 505 Jet Ranger X, a short-light single helicopter, is expected to receive certification and begin deliveries in 2016. In addition, Bell achieved first flight in 2015 for the 525 Relentless, its first super medium commercial helicopter, and expects certification in 2017. 

&#160; 

For both its military programs and its commercial products, Bell provides post-sale support and service for an installed base of approximately 13,000 helicopters through a network of eight Bell-operated service centers, five global parts distribution centers and over 100 independent service centers located in 34 countries. Collectively, these service sites offer a complete range of logistics support, including parts, support equipment, technical data, training devices, pilot and maintenance training, component repair and overhaul, engine repair and overhaul, aircraft modifications, aircraft customizing, accessory manufacturing, contractor maintenance, field service and product support engineering. 

&#160; 

Bell competes against a number of competitors throughout the world for its helicopter business and its parts and support business. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and reliability, product support, performance and reputation.

&#160; 

Our automotive products have several major competitors worldwide, some of which are affiliated with the OEMs that comprise our targeted customer base. Competition typically is based on a number of factors including price, technology, environmental performance, product quality and reliability, prior experience and available manufacturing capacity. 

&#160; 

Specialized Vehicles and Equipment 

Our Specialized Vehicles and Equipment product line includes the products designed, manufactured and sold by our Textron Specialized Vehicles and Jacobsen businesses. Textron Specialized Vehicles, which includes the E-Z-GO, Bad Boy Off Road, Cushman, TUG Technologies and Douglas Equipment businesses and brands, designs, manufactures and sells golf cars, off-road utility vehicles, light transportation vehicles and aviation ground support equipment. Although Textron Specialized Vehicles is 

&#160; 

&#160; 

best known for its electric-vehicle technology, it also manufactures and sells models powered by internal combustion engines. Textron Specialized Vehicles&#146; diversified customer base includes golf courses and resorts, government agencies and municipalities, consumers, and commercial and industrial users such as factories, warehouses, airports, planned communities, hunting preserves and educational and corporate campuses. Sales are made through a combination of factory direct resources and a network of independent distributors and dealers worldwide. Textron Specialized Vehicles has two major competitors for golf cars and several other competitors for off-road and light transportation vehicles and for aviation ground support equipment. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and reliability, product support and reputation.

&#160; 

Jacobsen designs, manufactures and sells professional turf-maintenance equipment, as well as specialized turf-care vehicles. Brand names include Ransomes, Jacobsen, Cushman and Dixie Chopper. Jacobsen&#146;s customers include golf courses, resort communities, sporting venues, municipalities and landscaping professionals. Products are sold primarily through a worldwide network of distributors and dealers, as well as factory direct. Jacobsen has two major competitors for professional turf-maintenance equipment and several other major competitors for specialized turf-care products. Competition is based primarily on price, product features, product quality and reliability and product support. 

&#160; 

Tools and Test Equipment 

The Tools and Test Equipment product line includes products sold by businesses that design and manufacture powered equipment, electrical test and measurement instruments, mechanical and hydraulic tools, cable connectors, fiber optic assemblies, underground and aerial transmission and distribution products and power utility products. These businesses also encompass the Greenlee, Greenlee Communications, Greenlee Utility, HD Electric, Klauke, Sherman+Reilly and Endura brand names, and their products are used principally in the construction, maintenance, telecommunications, data communications, electrical, utility and plumbing industries. Their products are distributed through a global network of sales representatives and distributors and are also sold directly to home improvement retailers and OEMs. The businesses have plant operations in five countries with almost 50% of their combined revenue coming from outside the United States. These businesses face competition from numerous manufacturers based primarily on price, delivery lead time, product quality and reliability. 

&#160; 

Finance Segment 

Our Finance segment, or the Finance group, is a commercial finance business that consists of Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Finance segment provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters. The majority of new finance receivables are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the U.S. New originations in the U.S. are primarily for purchasers who had difficulty in accessing other sources of financing for the purchase of Textron-manufactured products. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Finance group paid our Manufacturing group $194 million, $215 million and $248 million, respectively, related to the sale of Textron-manufactured products to third parties that were financed by the Finance group. 

&#160; 

The commercial finance business traditionally is extremely competitive. Our Finance segment is subject to competition from various types of financing institutions, including banks, leasing companies, commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment vendors. Competition within the commercial finance industry primarily is focused on price, term, structure and service. 

&#160; 

Our Finance segment&#146;s largest business risk is the collectability of its finance receivable portfolio. See &#147;Finance Portfolio Quality&#148; in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; on page 27 for information about the Finance segment&#146;s credit performance.

Approximately 44% of our total backlog at January 2, 2016 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2016. 

&#160; 

At the end of 2015, approximately 68% of our total backlog was with the U.S. Government, which included only funded amounts as the U.S. Government is obligated only up to the amount of funding formally appropriated for a contract. Bell&#146;s 2015 backlog included $2.0 billion related to a multi-year procurement contract with the U.S. Government for the purchase of V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. 

&#160; 

U.S. Government Contracts 

In 2015, approximately 24% of our consolidated revenues were generated by or resulted from contracts with the U.S. Government, excluding those contracts under the U.S. Government sponsored foreign military sales program. This business is subject to competition, changes in procurement policies and regulations, the continuing availability of funding, which is dependent upon congressional appropriations, national and international priorities for defense spending, world events, and the size and timing of programs in which we may participate. 

&#160; 

Our contracts with the U.S. Government generally may be terminated by the U.S. Government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination, including, if applicable, reasonable profit on such work, as well as reasonable termination costs. If, however, the U.S. Government terminates a contract for default, generally: (a) we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted and services rendered, an agreed-upon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property, and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the U.S. Government; (b) the U.S. Government may not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and may be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract; (c) the U.S. Government may not be liable for assets we own and utilize to provide services under the &#147;fee-for-service&#148; contracts; and (d) we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

Information regarding our research and development expenditures is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 46 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Patents and Trademarks 

We own, or are licensed under, numerous patents throughout the world relating to products, services and methods of manufacturing. Patents developed while under contract with the U.S. Government may be subject to use by the U.S. Government.

Environmental Considerations 

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with these laws and expenditures for environmental control facilities has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additional information regarding environmental matters is contained in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 65 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
