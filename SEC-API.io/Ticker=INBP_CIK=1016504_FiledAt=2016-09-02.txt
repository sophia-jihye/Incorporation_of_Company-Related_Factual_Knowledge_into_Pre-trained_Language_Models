 Item 1. Description of Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

Integrated BioPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company &#8221;), is engaged primarily in manufacturing, distributing, marketing and sales of vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products. The Company&#8217;s customers are located primarily in the United States, Luxembourg and Canada. The Company was previously known as Integrated Health Technologies, Inc. and, prior to that, as Chem International, Inc. The Company was reincorporated in its current form in Delaware in 1995. The Company continues to do business as Chem International, Inc. with certain of its customers and certain vendors. 

&#160;

The Company &#8217;s business segments include: (a) Contract Manufacturing operated by InB:Manhattan Drug Company, Inc. (&#8220;MDC&#8221;), which manufactures vitamins and nutritional supplements for sale to distributors, multilevel marketers and specialized health-care providers; (b) Branded Proprietary Products operated by AgroLabs, Inc. (&#8220;AgroLabs&#8221;), which distributes healthful nutritional products for sale through major mass market, grocery, drug and vitamin retailers, under the following brands: Naturally Noni, Coconut Water, Aloe Pure, Peaceful Sleep, Green Envy, ACAI Extra, ACAI Daily Cleanse, Wheatgrass and other products which are being introduced into the market (these are referred to as our branded proprietary nutraceutical business and/or products); and (c) Other Nutraceutical Businesses which includes the operations of (i) The Vitamin Factory (the &#8220;Vitamin Factory&#8221;), which sells private label MDC products, as well as our AgroLabs products, through the Internet, (ii) IHT Health Products, Inc. (&#8220;IHT&#8221;) a distributor of fine natural botanicals, including multi minerals produced under a license agreement, (iii) MDC Warehousing and Distribution, Inc., a service provider for warehousing and fulfilment services and (iv) Chem International, Inc., a distributor of certain raw materials for DSM Nutritional Products LLC. 

&#160;

Significant Revenues from Major Customers 

&#160;

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 a significant portion of our consolidated net sales, approximately 90% and 84%, respectively, were concentrated among two customers, Herbalife International of America, Inc. (&#8220;Herbalife&#8221;) and Life Extension Quality Supplements and Vitamins, Inc. (&#8220;Life Extension&#8221;), both customers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. Herbalife and Life Extension represented approximately 39% and 56% and 49% and 43%, respectively, of our Contract Manufacturing Segment&#8217;s net sales in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Costco Wholesale Corporation (&#8220;Costco&#8221;) (a customer of our Branded Proprietary Products Segment), while not a significant customer of our consolidated net sales represented approximately 51% and 77% of net sales in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of the Branded Propriety Products Segment. The loss of any of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process in the Company &#8217;s business are natural and synthetic vitamins, minerals, herbs, related nutritional supplements, gelatin capsules, coating materials, organic and natural fruit extracts, fruit juices and the necessary components for packaging the finished products. The raw materials are available from numerous sources within the United States and abroad. The gelatin capsules, coating materials and packaging materials are similarly widely available. The Company generally purchases its raw materials, on a purchase order basis, without long-term commitments in each of its operating segments. 

&#160;

Development and Supply Agreement 

&#160;

Effective July 15, 2009, the Company entered into a development and supply agreement with Herbalife and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which the Company develops, manufactures and supplies certain nutritional products to Herbalife. This agreement was amended on June 12, 2015 to extend the term through December 31, 2018. 

&#160;

&#160;

This agreement does not, however, obligate the Company to supply any particular amount of goods to Herbalife, nor does it obligate Herbalife to commit to a minimum order, if any. In its ordinary course of business, the Company has similar agreements with other customers in connection with its contract manufacturing business. 

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

The nutraceutical business tends to be seasonal. We have found that in our first fiscal quarter ending on September 30 th of each year, orders for our branded proprietary nutraceutical products usually slow (absent the addition of new customers or a new product launch with a significant first time order), as buyers in various markets may have purchased sufficient inventory to carry them through the summer months. Conversely, in our second fiscal quarter, ending on December 31 st of each year, orders for our products increase as the demand for our branded nutraceutical products, as well as sales orders from our customers in our contract manufacturing segment, seem to increase in late December to early January as consumers become health conscious as they enter the new year. 

&#160;

The Company believes that there are other non-seasonal factors that also may influence the variability of quarterly results including, but not limited to, general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending, changing consumer demands and current news on nutritional supplements. Accordingly, a comparison of the Company &#8217;s results of operations from consecutive periods is not necessarily meaningful, and the Company&#8217;s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future periods. 

&#160;

Variability of Quarterly Results and Impact of Advertising 

&#160;

Advertising and promotional spending for our branded nutraceutical business in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Advertising and promotional spending was substantially curtailed beginning in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as a result of the lack of sales to customers in the domestic club store chains where we supported the sales of our branded propriety nutraceutical products with in store demos as well as promotional discounts. As we continue to support our branded nutraceutical business and pursue regaining distribution in the club stores, we may incur increased advertising and promotional expenses. Such expenses include promotional activities conducted through the retail trade, distributors or directly with consumers, including in-store displays, product placement programs, coupons, radio and print advertising, and other similar activities. Since such expenses may occur in fiscal quarters before increases, if any, in revenues occur as a result of the advertising and promotion, the program may increase variability of our quarterly results. Other factors that also may influence the variability of quarterly results include general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending, changing consumer demands and current news on nutritional supplements. Accordingly, a comparison of our results of operations from consecutive periods is not necessarily meaningful, and our results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future periods. 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling and advertising of our products are subject to regulation by a number of federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;), the United States Postal Service, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the United States Department of Agriculture. Our activities are also regulated by various state and local agencies in which our products are sold. The FDA is primarily responsible for the regulation of the manufacturing, labeling and sale of our products. The operation of our vitamin manufacturing facility is subject to regulation by the FDA as a dietary supplement manufacturing facility. The United States Postal Service and the FTC regulate advertising claims with respect to the Company &#8217;s products. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in compliance with the guidelines promulgated by the United States Pharmacopoeia Convention, Inc. (&#8220;USP&#8221;) and other voluntary standard organizations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (&#8220;DSHEA&#8221;) was enacted on October 25, 1994. The Dietary Supplement Act amends the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FFD&#38;CA&#8221;) by defining dietary supplements, which include vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements and herbs, and by providing a regulatory framework to ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating the active ingredients in dietary supplements as food additives, or as drugs unless product claims trigger drug status. The DSHEA requires the FDA to regulate dietary supplements so as to guarantee consumer access to beneficial dietary supplements, allowing only truthful and proven claims. Generally, dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15, 1994 may be sold without FDA pre-approval and without notifying the FDA. However, new dietary ingredients (those not used in dietary supplements marketed before October 15, 1994) require pre-market submission to the FDA of evidence of a history of their safe use, or other evidence establishing that they are reasonably expected to be safe. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient we may decide to use. The FDA &#8217;s refusal to accept such evidence could result in regulation of such dietary ingredients as food additives, requiring the FDA pre-approval based on newly conducted, costly safety testing. 

&#160;

DSHEA provides for specific nutritional labeling requirements for dietary supplements effective January 1, 1997. The Dietary Supplement Act permits substantiated, truthful and non-misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling, such as statements describing general well-being from consumption of a dietary ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining the structure or function of the body. The FDA requires the Company to notify the FDA of such statements. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not consider particular labeling statements used by us to be drug claims rather than acceptable statements of nutritional support, necessitating approval of a costly new drug application, or re-labeling to delete such statements. It is also possible that the FDA could allege false statements were submitted to it if structure/function claim notifications were either non-existent or so lacking in scientific support as to be plainly false.

&#160;

As authorized by DSHEA, the FDA adopted Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) specifically for dietary supplements (21 CFR Part 111). These GMP regulations, which became effective in June 2008, are more detailed than the GMPs that previously applied to dietary supplements and require, among other things, dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged and held in compliance with specific rules, and require quality controls similar to those required by GMP regulations for drugs. We believe our manufacturing and distribution practices comply with these rules. 

&#160;

Dietary supplements are also subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act (&#8220;NLEA&#8221;), which regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in a product. NLEA prohibits the use of any health claim for dietary supplements unless the health claim is supported by significant agreement within the scientific community and is pre-approved by the FDA.

&#160;

In certain markets, including the United States, claims made with respect to dietary supplements may change the regulatory status of our products. For example, in the United States, the FDA could possibly take the position that claims made for some of our products classify those products as new drugs requiring pre-approval by the FDA. The FDA could also place those products within the scope of its over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) drug regulations and require us to comply with a published FDA OTC monograph. OTC monographs dictate permissible ingredients, appropriate labeling language and require the marketer or supplier of the products to register and file annual drug listing information with the FDA. We do not, at present, sell OTC drug products. If the FDA were to assert that our product claims cause them to be considered new drugs or to fall within the scope of OTC regulations, we would be required to either, file a new drug application, comply with the applicable monographs, or change the claims made in connection with those products.

&#160;

The FTC regulates the marketing practices and advertising of all our products. In recent years, the FTC instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement companies for false and misleading marketing practices and advertising of certain products. These enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and monetary payments by the companies involved. Under FTC standards, the dissemination of any false advertising constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice actionable under Section 45 of the Fair Trade Commission Act and a false advertisement actionable under Section 52 of that Act.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

A false advertisement is one that is &#8220;misleading in a material respect.&#8221; In determining whether an advertisement or labeling information is misleading in a material respect, the FTC determines not only whether overt and implied representations are false but also whether the advertisement fails to reveal material facts. Under the FTC &#8217;s standards, any health benefit representation made in advertising must be backed by &#8220;competent and reliable scientific evidence&#8221; by which the FTC means: &#8220;tests, analyses, research studies, or other evidence based upon the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted by the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.&#8221; 

&#160;

The FTC has increased its review of the use of the type of testimonials that may be used to market our products. The FTC requires competent and reliable evidence substantiating claims and testimonials at the time that such claims of health benefit are first made. The failure to have this evidence when product claims are first made violates the Federal Trade Commission Act. Although the FTC has never threatened an enforcement action against the Company for the advertising of its products, there can be no assurance that the FTC will not question the advertising for our products in the future.

&#160;

We believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable government regulations. We cannot predict what new legislation or regulations governing our operations will be enacted by legislative bodies or promulgated by agencies that regulate its activities. The FDA is expected to increase its enforcement activity against dietary supplements that it considers to be in violation of FFD&#38;CA. In particular, the FDA is increasing its enforcement of DSHEA provisions. Those activities will be enhanced by the appropriation for increased FDA budgets for dietary supplement regulation enforcement. 

&#160;

We believe we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or other federal, state, or foreign regulatory authorities. We also believe the laws or regulations which are considered favorable may be repealed, or more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations may be implemented. Any or all of such requirements could be a burden to us. Future regulations could require us to:

&#160;

&#9679; change the way we conduct business;

&#9679; use expanded or different labeling;

&#9679; recall, reformulate or discontinue certain products;

&#9679; keep additional records;

&#9679; increase the available documentation of the properties of its products; and/or

&#9679; increase the scientific proof of product ingredients, safety, and/or usefulness.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The business of manufacturing, distributing and marketing vitamins and nutritional supplements is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources with which to manufacture and market their products. In particular, the retail segment is highly competitive. Many direct marketers not only focus on selling their own branded products, but offer national brands at discounts as well. Many competitors have established brand names recognizable to consumers. In addition, major pharmaceutical companies offer nationally advertised multivitamin products.

&#160; 

Many of our competitors in the retailing segment have the financial resources to advertise freely, to promote sales and to produce sophisticated catalogs and websites. In many cases, such competitors are able to offer price incentives for retail purchasers and to offer participation in frequent buyers programs. Some retail competitors also manufacture their own products whereby they have the ability and financial incentive to sell their own product. 

&#160; 

We intend to compete by stressing the quality of our manufactured product, providing prompt service, competitive pricing of products in our marketing segment and by focusing on niche products in international retail markets.

&#160; 

&#160;

Research and Development Activities 

&#160; 

We do not conduct any significant research and development activities.

&#160; 

Environmental Compliance 

&#160;

We are subject to regulation under Federal, state and local environmental laws. While we believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, continued compliance may require substantial capital expenditures. We have not incurred any major costs for any environmental compliance during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 2, 2016, we had approximately 120 full time employees of whom 75 belong to the local unit of the Teamsters Union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expired on August 30, 2015 and was renewed on September 1, 2015 for an additional 3 year term ending on August 31, 2018. The 45 employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement consisted of approximately 18 administrative and professional personnel, 14 laboratory personnel, 5 sales and marketing personnel and 8 production and shipping personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160;

In November 2013, we entered into an agreement with a Professional Employer Organization (&#8220;PEO&#8221;) and terminated our agreement with the previous PEO. The PEO agreements established a three-way relationship between our non-union employees, the PEO and us. We and the PEO are co-employers of our non-union employees. The PEO has taken responsibility for our Human Resources administration and compliance, which allows us to continue to exercise control over our business while accessing quality employee benefits. We have been using PEOs since January 2007.
