 Item 1. Business.

Overview

We are a bank holding company headquartered in Prattville, Alabama. River Bank &#38; Trust was formed as an Alabama banking corporation in March 2006. In November 2012, River Financial Corporation was formed as an Alabama corporation and all the common shares of River Bank &#38; Trust were exchanged for common shares of River Financial Corporation and River Bank &#38; Trust became the wholly owned subsidiary of River Financial Corporation. On December 31, 2015, River Financial Corporation merged with Keystone Bancshares, Inc. (Keystone), the parent company of Keystone Bank, Inc. with River Financial Corporation being the surviving entity. At the time of the merger of River Financial Corporation and Keystone Bancshares, Inc., Keystone Bank was merged into River Bank &#38; Trust.

We operate one subsidiary bank, River Bank &#38; Trust. Through the Bank, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners, and professionals. We currently conduct our banking operations through our Banks&#8217; 9 banking locations in Alabama. We operate nine full-service banking offices, located in Montgomery, Prattville, Auburn, Opelika, and Gadsden.

As of December 31, 2015, we had total assets of $718.0 million, total loans of $479.3 million, total deposits of $610.4 million, and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $74.9 million.

Our Products and Services

Through our Bank, we engage in the business of banking, which consists primarily of accepting deposits from the public and making loans and other investments. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investments at our Bank are demand, time, savings, and other deposits (including negotiable orders of withdrawal, or NOW accounts) and the amortization and prepayments of loans and investments. Our principal sources of income are interest and fees collected on loans, interest collected on other investments, fees earned from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, and service charges, as well as income from investment brokerage services. Our principal expenses are interest paid on savings and other deposits (including NOW accounts), interest paid on other borrowings, employee compensation, office expenses, and other overhead expenses.

Deposits

Our principal sources of funds are core deposits, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, savings deposits, and certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2015, our deposit composition was as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

Deposit rates are reviewed weekly by senior management. Management believes that the rates that we offer are competitive with those offered by other institutions in our market areas. We also focus on customer service to attract and retain deposits.

Transaction accounts include demand deposits and NOW accounts, which customers use for cash management and which provide us with a source of fee income, as well as a low-cost source of funds. Time and savings accounts also provide a relatively stable and low-cost source of funds. Our primary source of funds is NOW accounts. Certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 are held primarily by customers in our market areas. We utilize brokered certificates of deposit to supplement our market funding sources when funding needs or pricing warrants the use of wholesale funding.

Lending 

We offer a range of lending services, including real estate, consumer, and commercial loans, to individuals, small businesses, and other organizations located in or conducting a substantial portion of their business in our market areas. Our total loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2015, were approximately $479.3 million, or approximately 66.8% of total assets. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations.

As of December 31, 2015, our loan portfolio composition was classified as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

Real Estate Loans . Loans secured by real estate are the primary component of our loan portfolio, constituting approximately $388.1 million, or 79.6%, of total loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2015. We originate consumer and commercial loans for the purpose of acquiring real estate that are secured by such real estate (CRE). We also often take real estate as an additional source of collateral to secure commercial and industrial (C&#38;I) loans. Such loans are classified as real estate loans rather than commercial and industrial loans if the real estate collateral is considered significant as a secondary source of repayment for the loan. Loans are typically made on a recourse basis supported by financial statements and a review of the repayment ability of the borrower(s) and/or guarantor(s). Origination fees are charged for many loans secured by real estate. 

Real estate lending activities consist of the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

Commercial real estate term loans accrue at either variable or fixed rates. The variable rates approximate current market rates. Amortizations are typically no more than 25 years. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The primary type of residential mortgage loan is the single-family first mortgage, typically structured with fixed or adjustable interest rates, based on market conditions. These loans usually have fixed rates for up to 5 years, with maturities of 15 to 30 years. We also originate home equity lines of credit secured by residential property. These loans are typically made on a variable-rate basis with maturities up to 10 years. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Construction and land development (C&#38;D) loans are typically made on a variable-rate basis. Loan terms usually do not exceed 24 months. 

We originate residential loans for sale into the secondary market. These loans are made in accordance with underwriting standards set by the purchaser of the loan, normally as to loan-to-value ratio, interest rate, borrower qualification, and documentation. These loans are generally made under a commitment to purchase from a loan purchaser. We generally collect from the borrower or purchaser a combination of the origination fee, discount points, and/or a service release fee.

Commercial and Industrial Loans . We make loans for commercial purposes in various lines of business. These loans are typically made on terms up to 7 years at fixed or variable rates. The loans are secured by various types of collateral, including accounts receivable, inventory, or, in the case of equipment loans, the financed equipment. We attempt to reduce our credit risk on commercial loans by underwriting the loan based on the borrower&#8217;s cash flow and its ability to service the debt from earnings, and by limiting the loan-to-value ratio. Historically, we have typically loaned up to 80% on loans secured by accounts receivable, up to 50% on loans secured by inventory (which are typically also secured by accounts receivable), and up to 100% on loans secured by equipment. We also make some unsecured commercial loans. Commercial and industrial loans constituted $79.6 million, or 16.3% of our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2015. Interest rates are negotiable based upon the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, credit history, management stability and collateral. 

Consumer Loans . Consumer lending includes installment lending to individuals in our market areas and generally consists of loans to purchase automobiles and other consumer durable goods. Consumer loans constituted $19.6 million, or 4.0% of our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2015. Consumer loans are underwritten base d on the borrower&#8217;s income, current debt level, past credit history and collateral. Consumer rates are both variable and fixed, with terms negotiable. Terms generally range from one to five years depending on the nature and condition of the collateral. Per iodic amortization, generally monthly, is typically required. 

Loan Approval . Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These include repayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In particular, longer maturities increase the risk that economic conditions will change and adversely affect collectability. 

We attempt to minimize loan losses through various means and the use of standardized underwriting criteria. We have established a standardized loan policy that may be modified based on local market conditions. In particular, on larger credits, we generally rely on the cash flow of a debtor as the source of repayment and secondarily on the value of the underlying collateral. In addition, we attempt to utilize shorter loan terms in order to reduce the risk of a decline in the value of such collateral.

We address repayment risks by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer lending limits, a loan committee approval process for larger loans, documentation examination, and follow-up procedures for loan review and any exceptions to credit policies. The point in the loan approval process at which a loan is approved depends on the size of the borrower&#8217;s credit relationship with the bank and the loan authority of the lending officer to whom the loan request is made. Each of our lending officers has the authority to approve loans up to an approved loan authority amount, as approved by the bank&#8217;s board of directors. Loans in excess of the highest loan authority amount of a particular lending officer must be approved by the bank&#8217;s loan committee, or another officer with sufficient loan authority to approve the request.

Risk Ratings . Loan officers are directly responsible for monitoring the risk in their respective portfolios. On commercial loans, risk grades are assigned by the loan officer for the probability of default following analysis of borrower characteristics and external economic factors. However, on consumer loans, risk grades are determined by a borrower&#8217;s credit score and personal debt ratio, as well as the borrower&#8217;s repayment history with the bank. 

Electronic Banking

We offer electronic banking services to our customers, including commercial and retail online banking, automated bill payment, mobile banking, and remote deposit capture for certain customers.

Market Areas

We currently conduct our banking operations through our Banks&#8217; 9 banking locations in the state of Alabama. The locations include Montgomery, Prattville, Wetumpka, Auburn, Opelika, Alexander City, and Gadsden. Our market areas generally include the Montgomery, Auburn-Opelika, and Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Areas.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive. We compete for loans, deposits, and financial services in all of our principal markets. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our markets, internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our markets, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current customers, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established customer base and name recognition. We believe that our competitive pricing, personalized service, and community involvement enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 118 full-time and 11 part-time employees. None of these employees is party to a collective bargaining agreement.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General

We are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with various consumer protection provisions applicable to lending, deposit, brokerage, and fiduciary activities. They also impose capital adequacy requirements and conditions on a bank holding company&#8217;s ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from its subsidiary banks. We are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve, and River Bank and Trust is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Alabama Banking Department. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of our activities.

In December 2015, we completed a merger with Keystone, pursuant to which we acquired control of Keystone Bank. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Keystone was merged with and into RB&#38;T, with RB&#38;T surviving the merger.

To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us, are difficult to ascertain. A change in applicable laws and regulations, or in the manner such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on our business, operations, and earnings.

Regulation of River Financial Corporation

We are registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;) and are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The BHCA requires us to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before we own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, or merge or consolidate with another bank or thrift holding company. Further, under the BHCA, our activities and those of any nonbank subsidiary are limited to: (i) those activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, and (ii) investments in companies not engaged in activities closely related to banking, subject to quantitative limitations on the value of such investments. Prior approval of the Federal Reserve may be required before engaging in certain activities. In making such determinations, the Federal Reserve is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices.

Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively deemed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company, and a rebuttable presumption arises if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either: (i) the bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Act; or (ii) no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.

The BHCA was substantially amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLBA, which, among other things, permits a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; to engage in a broader range of non-banking activities, and to engage on less restrictive terms in certain activities than were previously permitted. These expanded activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and sales, and merchant banking activities. To become a financial holding company, a bank holding company must certify that all depository institutions that it controls are both &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; (as defined by federal law), and have at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating. The GLBA also imposes certain privacy requirements on all financial institutions and their treatment of consumer information. At this time, we have not elected to become a financial holding company, nor do we expect to make such an election in the foreseeable future.

There are a number of restrictions imposed on us by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the insurance fund maintained by the FDIC (as discussed in more detail below) in the event that a subsidiary depository institution should become insolvent. For example, federal law requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so in the absence of such a policy. The Federal Reserve also has the authority under the BHCA to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the Federal Reserve&#8217;s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

Any capital loan by a bank holding company to a subsidiary deposit ory institution is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the institution. In addition, in the event of the holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment made by the bank holding company to a federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary depository institution(s) will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as a subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non- deposit creditors, including the institution&#8217;s holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.

Regulation of River Bank and Trust

The operations and investments of RB&#38;T are subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the FDIC, the Alabama Banking Department, as well as other federal banking statutes and regulations, including with respect to the level of reserves that RB&#38;T must maintain against deposits, restrictions on the types, amount, and terms and conditions of loans it may originate, and limits on the types of other activities in which RB&#38;T may engage and the investments that it may make. The FDIC and Alabama Banking Department also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law.

Transactions with Affiliates

We are subject to federal laws, such as Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, that limit the size and number of the transactions that depository institutions may engage in with their affiliates. Under these provisions, transactions (such as loans or investments) by a bank with nonbank affiliates are generally limited to 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus for all covered transactions with any one affiliate, and 20% of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all affiliates. Any extensions of credit to affiliates, with limited exceptions, must be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Banks are also prohibited from purchasing any &#8220;low quality&#8221; assets from an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional requirements on transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.

We are also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to our executive officers, directors, principal stockholders, and their related interests. These extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Furthermore, we are prohibited from engaging in asset purchases or sales transactions with our officers, directors, or principal stockholders unless the transaction is on market terms and, if the transaction represents greater than 10% of the capital and surplus of the bank, a majority of the bank&#8217;s disinterested directors has approved the transaction.

Monetary Policy

Our earnings are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant effect upon the operating results of commercial banks. The Federal Reserve has a major impact upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on bank borrowings and the reserve requirements against bank deposits. It is not possible for us to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.

Deposit Insurance

Our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC. The DIF is the successor to the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which were merged in 2006. Under the FDIC&#8217;s current risk-based assessment system, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act and the FDIC&#8217;s final rule on assessments, dividend assessment base and large bank pricing, or the Assessment Rule, insured institutions are assigned to one of four categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels, and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and the applicability of certain potential adjustments established by FDIC regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower assessment rates.

The assessment base against which the assessment rate is applied to determine the total assessment due for a given period is the depository institution&#8217;s average total consolid ated assets during the assessment period less average tangible equity during that assessment period. Tangible equity is defined in the Assessment Rule as Tier 1 Capital and is calculated monthly, unless the insured depository institution has less than $1 b illion in assets, in which case the insured depository institution calculates Tier 1 Capital on an end-of-quarter basis. Parents or holding companies of other insured depository institutions are required to report separately from their subsidiary depositor y institutions. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also eliminated the ceiling and increased the floor on the size of the DIF. It established a minimum designated reserve ratio, or the DRR, of 1.35 percent of the estimated insured deposits and required the FDIC to adopt a restoration plan should the reserve ratio fall below 1.35 percent. However, the assessment rate schedules used to determine assessments due from insured depository institutions become progressively lower when the reserve ratio in the DIF exceeds 1.15 percent, 2 percent, and 2.5 percent.

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, insured depository institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. This payment is established quarterly and, for each of the four quarters in calendar year 2014, equaled 0.62 basis points on assessable deposits.

The Dodd-Frank Act also raised the limit for federal deposit insurance to $250,000 and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000.

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on our operating expenses and results of operations. We cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Furthermore, deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Dividend Restrictions

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our Bank. Our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions depends in part upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiary bank and is limited by federal and state law. The specific limits depend upon a number of factors, including a bank subsidiary&#8217;s type of charter, recent earnings, recent dividends, level of capital, and regulatory status. The regulators are authorized, and under certain circumstances are required, to determine that the payment of dividends or other distributions by a bank would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit that payment. For example, the FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.

The bank generally may not withdraw, either in the form of a dividend or otherwise, any portion of its permanent capital and may not declare a dividend in excess of its retained net profits. Further, dividends that may be paid by the bank without the express approval of the Alabama Banking Department are limited to an amount equal to the bank&#8217;s retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as defined by Alabama Banking Law, consist of net income, less dividends declared during the period, plus the provision for loan losses, less net loan charge-offs.

The ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends and make distributions can also be limited by other laws or regulations. The Federal Reserve, which has authority to prohibit a bank holding company from paying dividends or making other distributions, has issued a Supervisory Letter stating that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company&#8217;s financial health, such as by borrowing. The Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III (described below), and their respective implementing regulations impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends.

Capital Adequacy Guidelines

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, or Basel III. Basel III requires banks to maintain a higher level of capital than previously required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed generally applicable capital requirements with respect to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries and mandated that the federal banking regulatory agencies adopt rules and regulations to implement the Basel III requirements.

Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to apply consolidated capital requirements to a bank holding company that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule, or the Basel III Final Rule, implementing these standards. Under the Basel III Final Rule, trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier I capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets, subject to certain limits. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally provides for countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expa nsion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. Under the Basel III Final Rule, which implements this concept, banks must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity Tier 1 capit al equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above each of the required minimum capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. This new capital conservation buffer requ irement is currently being phased beginning in 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% in January 2019. 

For purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets, the federal banking agencies have promulgated risk-based capital guidelines designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposures, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and off- balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.

Bank assets are given risk-weights under the Basel III Final Rule. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are assigned certain credit conversion factors to convert them to asset- equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk-weighting will apply. Those computations result in the total risk-weighted assets. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category, except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by residential property, which carry a 50% risk weighting. Most investment securities (including, primarily, general obligation claims of states or other political subdivisions of the United States) are assigned to the 20% category. Exceptions include municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk weighting, and direct obligations of the United States Treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which have a 0% risk weighting. In converting off-balance sheet items, direct credit substitutes, including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations, are given a 100% risk weighting. Transaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds, standby letters of credit backing non-financial obligations, and undrawn commitments (including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year) have a 50% risk weighting. Short-term commercial letters of credit have a 20% risk weighting, and certain short-term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a 0% risk weighting.

Under the Basel III Final Rule, as of January 1, 2015, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. The required ratio of &#8220;Tier 1 Capital&#8221; (consisting generally of shareholders&#8217; equity and qualifying preferred stock, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets) to risk- weighted assets is 6%. While there was previously no required ratio of &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 Capital&#8221; (which generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, certain qualifying capital instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, subject to certain adjustments) to risk-weighted assets, a required minimum ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015 as well. The remainder of total capital, or &#8220;Tier 2 Capital,&#8221; may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) perpetual debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities, and (f) certain subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital (which is included only to the extent of Tier 1 Capital), less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and any other deductions as determined by the appropriate regulator.

In addition, the federal banking agencies have established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations they supervise, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. Prior to the effective date of the Basel III Final Rule, banks and bank holding companies meeting certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing significant growth or expansion, were permitted to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3%. Other banks and bank holding companies generally were required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio between 4% and 5%. Under the Basel III Final Rule, as of January 1, 2015, the required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.

As an additional means of identifying problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the federal banking regulatory agencies have established certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure, and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.

Prompt Corrective Action 

In addition to the required minimum capital levels described above, federal law establishes a system of &#8220;prompt corrective actions&#8221; that federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions that they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution which is not adequately capitalized. Under the prompt corrective action rules effective as of January 1, 2015, an institution is deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if its leverage ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio meet or exceed 5%, 6.5%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or better if its leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios meet or exceed the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements, and &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it fails to meet these minimum capital requirements. An institution is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if its leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios fall below 3%, 3%, 4%, and 6%, respectively, and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

The prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party. In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain automatic restrictions, including a prohibition on payment of dividends and a limitation on asset growth and expansion in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers, and a prohibition on the payment of certain &#8220;management fees&#8221; to any &#8220;controlling person.&#8221; Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring; limitations on the institution&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business; obligations to raise additional capital; restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits. In certain cases, banking regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors, or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser. If an institution is deemed to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; and continues in that category for 90 days, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership.

Community Reinvestment Act

The CRA requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to assess all financial institutions that they regulate to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities they serve, including their assessment area(s) (as established for these purposes in accordance with applicable regulations based principally on the location of branch offices). Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve,&#8221; or &#8220;unsatisfactory.&#8221; An institution&#8217;s record in meeting the requirements of the CRA is made publicly available and is taken into consideration in connection with any applications it files with federal regulators to engage in certain activities, including approval of a branch or other deposit facility, mergers and acquisitions, office relocations, or expansions into non-banking activities. The Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating at its most recent CRA evaluation.

USA PATRIOT Act

Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, which amended the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. The USA PATRIOT Act also mandates that financial institutions establish anti-money laundering programs meeting certain standards and requires the federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#8217;s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions.

Privacy of Customer Information

The GLBA and the implementing regulations issued by federal regulatory agencies require financial institutions (including banks, insurance agencies, and broker/dealers) to adopt policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, financial institutions are required to explain to customers their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, unless otherwise required or permitted by law, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in their policies and procedures. Specifically, the GLBA established certain information security guidelines that require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, which is an independent bureau with broad authority to regulate the consumer finance industry, including regulated financial institutions, non-banks and others involved in extending credit to consumers. The CFPB has authority through rulemaking, orders, policy statements, guidance, and enforcement actions to administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws, to oversee several entities and market segments not previously under the supervision of a federal regulator, and to impose its own regulations and pursue enforcement actions when it determines that a practice is unfair, deceptive, or abusive. The federal consumer financial laws and all of the functions and responsibilities associated with them, many of which were previously enforced by other federal regulatory agencies, were transferred to the CFPB on July 21, 2011. While the CFPB has the power to interpret, administer, and enforce federal consumer financial laws, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the federal banking regulatory agencies continue to have examination and enforcement powers over the financial institutions that they supervise relating to the matters within the jurisdiction of the CFPB if such institutions have less than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd- Frank Act also gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.

Mortgage Loan Origination

The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing final rule adopted by the CFPB, or the ATR/QM Rule, a financial institution may not make a residential mortgage loan to a consumer unless it first makes a &#8220;reasonable and good faith determination&#8221; that the consumer has a &#8220;reasonable ability&#8221; to repay the loan. In addition, the ATR/QM Rule limits prepayment penalties and permits borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage,&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. For this purpose, the ATR/QM Rule defines a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; to include a loan with a borrower debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they operate under federal conservatorship or receivership, and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, or United States Department of Agriculture. Additionally, a qualified mortgage may not: (i) contain excess upfront points and fees; (ii) have a term greater than 30 years; or (iii) include interest-only or negative amortization payments. The ATR/QM Rule specifies the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan&#8217;s monthly payments. The ATR/QM Rule became effective January 10, 2014.

In addition, Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities and generally prohibits sponsors from transferring or hedging that credit risk. In October 2014, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule to implement this requirement, or the Risk Retention Rule. Among other things, the Risk Retention Rule requires a securitizer to retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of any asset that the securitizer, through the issuance of an ABS, transfers, sells, or conveys to a third party; and prohibits a securitizer from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain. In certain situations, the final rule allows securitizers to allocate a portion of the risk retention requirement to the originator(s) of the securitized assets, if an originator contributes at least 20 percent of the assets in the securitization. The Risk Retention Rule also provides an exemption to the risk retention requirements for an ABS collateralized exclusively by Qualified Residential Mortgages, or QRMs, and ties the definition of a QRM to the definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; established by the CFPB for purposes of evaluating a consumer&#8217;s ability to repay a mortgage loan. The federal banking agencies have agreed to review the definition of QRMs in 2019, following the CFPB&#8217;s own review of its &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; regulation.

Mortgage Loan Servicing

On January 17, 2013, the CFPB issued a series of final rules as part of an ongoing effort to address mortgage servicing reforms and create uniform standards for the mortgage servicing industry. The rules contain additional requirements for communications with borrowers, address the maintenance of customer account records, govern procedures for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, and provide guidance regarding servicing delinquent loans, foreclosure proceedings, and loss mitigation efforts, among other measures. These rules became effective on January 10, 2014 and have in general led to increased costs to service loans across the mortgage industry.

The Volcker Rule

On December 10, 2013, five federal financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, adopted final rules implementing the so-called &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; embodied in Section 13 of the BHCA, which was added by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule completes the process begun in October 2011, when the agencies introduced proposed implementing rules for comment. In general, the Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in, and relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds, or covered 

funds. The Volcker Rule is intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and the related exemp tions and exclusions. 

The Volcker Rule also requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Community and small banks, like us, are afforded some relief under the Volcker Rule. If such banks are engaged only in exempted proprietary trading, such as trading in United States government, agency, state, and municipal obligations, they are exempt entirely from compliance program requirements. Moreover, even if a community or small bank engages in proprietary trading or covered fund activities under the rule, they need only incorporate references to the Volcker Rule into their existing policies and procedures.

On January 15, 2014, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule, or the Interim Rule, that exempts certain collateralized debt obligations backed by trust-preferred securities, also known as TruPS CDOs, from the broad restrictions of the Volcker Rule. Specifically, the Interim Rule provides that the covered fund restrictions of the Volcker Rule are inapplicable to a banking entity&#8217;s ownership interest in, or sponsorship of, any issuer of TruPS CDOs, provided that: (1) the TruPS CDOs were issued before May 19, 2010, by a holding company with $15 billion or less in total consolidated assets, and (2) the banking entity acquired the interest in the TruPS CDOs on or before December 10, 2013, or acquired the interest in the course of a merger with or acquisition of a banking entity that itself acquired the interest on or before that date.

Other Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law on July 21, 2010, implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape. In addition to the reforms previously mentioned, the Dodd-Frank Act also:

&#160;

&#183; 

Requires bank holding companies and banks to be both well-capitalized and well-managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state and requires any bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company to be both well-managed and well-capitalized; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Eliminates all remaining restrictions on interstate banking by authorizing national and state banks to establish de novo branches in any state that would permit a bank chartered in that state to open a branch at that location; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Repeals Regulation Q, the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhances insider transaction limitations by strengthening loan restrictions to insiders and applying the various limits to a greater number of types of transactions, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending or borrowing transactions. The law also restricts certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution&#8217;s board of directors; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Strengthens the previous limits on a depository institution&#8217;s credit exposure to one borrower (whether a person or group of related persons) in an amount exceeding certain thresholds, by expanding the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 

Although a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, many of the new requirements called for have yet to be implemented and will likely be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions&#8217; operations is unclear.

Federal Home Loan Bank Membership

River Bank and Trust is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, or the FHLBA. Each member of the FHLBA is required to maintain a minimum investment in the Class B stock of the FHLBA. The Board of Directors of the FHLBA can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase the level of investment in the FHLBA depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, we are unable to determine the extent of future required potential payments to the FHLBA at this time. Additionally, in the event that a member financial institution fails, the right of the FHLBA to seek repayment of funds loaned to that institution will take priority (a super lien) over the rights of all other creditors.

Ot her Laws and Regulations 

Our operations are subject to several additional laws, some of which are specific to banking and others of which are applicable to commercial operations generally. For example, with respect to our lending practices, we are subject to the following laws and regulations, among several others:

&#160;

&#183; 

Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections, and certain credit and other disclosures; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring certain disclosures concerning loan closing costs and escrows, and governing transfers of loan servicing and the amounts of escrows in connection with loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, imposing requirements and limitations on specific financial transactions and account relationships, intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Rules and regulations established by the National Flood Insurance Program; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act which set lending restrictions and limitations regarding loans and other extensions of credit made to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders, and other insiders; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, imposing restrictions regarding loans and other extensions of credit made by a bank to one or more of its affiliates; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

Our deposit operations are subject to federal laws applicable to depository accounts, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Truth-In-Savings Act, requiring certain disclosures for consumer deposit accounts; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal Reserve, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations that are not limited to banking organizations. For example, in lending to commercial and consumer borrowers, and in owning and operating our own property, we are subject to regulations and potential liabilities under state and federal environmental laws. In addition, we must comply with privacy and data security laws and regulations at both the federal and state level.

We are heavily regulated by regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. Like most of our competitors, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased regulation and regulatory and political scrutiny, which creates significant uncertainty for us, as well as for the financial services industry in general.

Enforcement Powers

The Financial Institution Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act, or FIRREA, expanded and increased the penalties available for use by the federal regulatory agencies against depository institutions and certain &#8220;institution-affiliated parties.&#8221; Institution-affiliated parties primarily include management, employees, and agents of a financial institution, as well as independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys, accountants, and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution&#8217;s affairs. An institution can be subject to an enforcement action due to the failure to timely file required reports, the filing of false or misleading 

information, or the submission of inaccurate reports, or engaging in other unsafe or unsound banking practices. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,425,000 per day for such violations. 

FIRREA provided regulators with greater flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties and to terminate an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance. It also expanded the power of banking regulatory agencies to issue regulatory orders. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies, and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency.

Future Legislation and Regulation

Regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry in recent years, leading in many cases to greater uncertainty and compliance costs for regulated entities. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could require us to make material expenditures, particularly in the form of personnel training costs and additional compliance expenses. We also may be required to change certain of our business practices in order to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to pursue business opportunities that we might otherwise consider pursuing, cause business disruptions, and/or have other impacts that are as of yet unknown to us. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in negative publicity, fines, or additional expenses.

Furthermore, proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the United States Congress, in state legislatures, and by applicable regulatory authorities. These proposals may change banking statutes and regulations and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that these proposals, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
