 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to &#8220;Natural Gas Services Group,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;ours&#8221; refer to Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. Certain specialized terms used in describing our natural gas compressor business are defined in "Glossary of Industry Terms" on page 8. 

The Company 

We are a leading provider of small to medium horsepower compression equipment to the natural gas industry. We focus primarily on the non-conventional natural gas and oil production business in the United States (such as coal bed methane, gas shale, tight gas and oil shales), which, according to data from the Energy Information Administration ("EIA"), is the single largest and fastest growing segment of U.S. hydrocarbon production. We manufacture, fabricate and rent natural gas compressors that enhance the production of natural gas wells and provide maintenance services for those compressors. In addition, we sell custom fabricated natural gas compressors to meet customer specifications dictated by well pressures, production characteristics and particular applications. We also manufacture and sell flare systems for oil and gas plant and production facilities. 

The vast majority of our rental operations are in non-conventional natural gas and oil regions, which typically have lower initial reservoir pressures, lower productions pressures and/or faster well decline rates. These areas usually require compression to be installed sooner and with greater frequency. 

&#32;Natural gas compressors are used in a number of applications for the production and enhancement of gas wells and in gas transportation lines and processing plants. Compression equipment is often required to boost a well&#8217;s production to economically viable levels and enable gas to continue to flow in the pipeline to its destination. 

We increased our revenue to $95.9 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;from $65.2 million &#32;in 2011 . During the same period, income from operations increased to $ 15.1 million &#32;from $14.9 million . Our compressor rental fleet has grown to 2,622 &#32;compressors at December 31, 2015 &#32;from 2,120 compressors at the end of 2011 . 

&#32;Our revenue decreased to $ 95.9 million &#32;from $97.0 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 . Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;decreased to $10.1 million &#32;( $0.79 &#32;per diluted share), as compared to $14.1 million &#32;( $1.11 &#32;per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014 . 

At December 31, 2015 , current assets were $73.2 million , which included $35.5 million &#32;of cash and cash equivalents. Current liabilities were $4.6 million , and our line of credit due in 2017 &#32;was $417,000 . Our stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was $224.0 million . 

See "Item 6, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further financial information. 

We were incorporated in Colorado on December 17, 1998 and maintain our principal offices at 508 W. Wall St., Suite 550, Midland, Texas 79701 and our telephone number is (432) 262-2700. 

Overview and Outlook 

The market for compression equipment and services is substantially dependent on the condition of the natural gas and oil industry. In particular, the willingness of natural gas and oil companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production of natural gas and oil in the U.S. The level of activity and capital expenditures has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view of future gas and oil prices, which are influenced by numerous factors, including the level of supply or demand for natural gas and oil and the impact on price of natural gas and oil, worldwide economic activity, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulation, seasonal fluctuations and weather patterns. Natural gas and oil prices and the level of production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility. Increasing oil and natural gas prices from 2005 through mid-2008 resulted in natural gas and oil operators increasing capital spending for exploration, development and production programs. However, in mid-2008, natural gas and oil prices began to decline. This decline resulted in reduced production and capital spending by some natural gas and oil companies, and had an impact on demand for compression equipment. 

The reduction in capital expenditures and production in the natural gas and oil industry, combined with problems in the global economy, led to a downturn in the demand for our products and services in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, a slow recovery began which produced an improvement in the utilization rate on our rental fleet and stability in our sales backlog. In 2012, we saw growth in demand for our products and that growth continued in 2013 and 2014. Towards the end of 2014 oil prices began a steep decline which has resulted in capital budget cuts for many energy companies in 2015. These budget reductions translated to fewer well completions and a softening of near-term demand for compression that is expected to continue throughout 2016. See &#8220;Item 1 -- Business &#8211; Our Operating Units&#8221; and &#8220;Business &#8211; Backlog&#8221; for more information. 

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (&#8220;EIA&#8221;), total consumption of natural gas in the United States increased 3.2% for the twelve months ended November 2015 &#32;compared to the same period 2014 . This follows a 2.8% and a 2.1% increase in the periods from 2013 &#32;to 2014 &#32;and 2012 &#32;to 2013 , respectively. EIA expects total natural gas consumption in the U.S. to increase slightly in 2016 . While we anticipate long-term increased demand for natural gas, we expect our business to experience significant pressure on revenues for 2016 &#32;due to the overall uncertainty in the combined oil and gas market. 

Long-Term Industry Trends 

Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Oil and natural gas are linked commodities with many drilling projects producing both products. The sustained oil price collapse that began towards the end of 2014 has made some of those drilling projects uneconomic. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future natural gas and near-term crude oil price and oil trends are down in the United States and worldwide. Over the last several years gas prices have not shown the resiliency that crude oil prices have and now crude prices are also down sharply. We believe that natural gas is a more environmentally friendly source of energy which is likely to result in increases in demand over time. Being primarily a provider of services and equipment to natural gas producers, we are impacted by changes in natural gas, crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. Prices for oil and natural gas will also be determined by the energy strategies of the world's top producing companies. 

We believe part of the growth of the rental compression capacity in the U.S. market has been driven by the trend toward outsourcing by energy producers and processors. Renting does not require the purchaser to make large capital expenditures for new equipment or to obtain financing through a lending institution. This allows the customer&#8217;s capital to be used for additional exploration and production of natural gas and oil. Balance sheet pressure associated with low energy prices could make renting an even more likely option, although overall producing activity could slow down. 

Notwithstanding the downturn in natural gas prices, we believe that there will continue to be a growing demand for natural gas, in the long-term. We expect long-term demand for our products and services will increase as prices recover as a result of: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the increasing demand for energy, both domestically and abroad; 

&#8226; 

continued non-conventional gas exploration and production; 

&#8226; 

environmental considerations which provide strong incentives to use natural gas in place of other carbon fuels; 

&#8226; 

the cost savings of using natural gas rather than electricity for heat generation; 

&#8226; 

implementation of international environmental and conservation laws; 

&#8226; 

the aging of producing natural gas reserves worldwide; 

&#8226; 

the extensive supply of undeveloped non-conventional natural gas reserves; 

&#8226; 

the increased drilling for shale oil and its associated gas production; and 

&#8226; 

the use of our equipment for gas lift on oil wells. 

Our Operating Units 

We identify our operating units based upon major revenue sources as Gas Compressor Rental, Engineered Equipment Sales, Service and Maintenance and Corporate. 

Gas Compressor Rental. Our rental business is primarily focused on non-conventional natural gas and oil production. We provide rental of small to medium horsepower compression equipment to customers under contracts typically 

having minimum initial terms of six to twenty four months. Historically, in our experience, most customers retain the equipment beyond the expiration of the initial term. By outsourcing their compression needs, we believe our customers are able to increase their revenues by producing a higher volume of natural gas due to greater equipment run-time. Outsourcing also allows our customers to reduce their compressor downtime, operating and maintenance costs and capital investments and more efficiently meet their changing compression needs. We maintain and service compressor equipment rented to our customers. 

The size, type and geographic diversity of our rental fleet enables us to provide our customers with a range of compression units that can serve a wide variety of applications, and to select the correct equipment for the job, rather than the customer trying to fit the job to its own equipment. We base our gas compressor rental rates on several factors, including the cost and size of the equipment, the type and complexity of service desired by the customer, the length of contract and the inclusion of any other services desired, such as installation, transportation and daily operation. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 2,622 &#32;natural gas compressors in our rental fleet totaling 372,482 &#32;horsepower, as compared to 2,879 &#32;natural gas compressors totaling 401,361 &#32;horsepower at December 31, 2014 . As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,818 &#32;natural gas compressors totaling 256,204 &#32;horsepower rented to 84 &#32;customers, compared to 2,189 &#32;natural gas compressors totaling 301,392 &#32;horsepower rented to 102 &#32;customers at December 31, 2014 . As of December 31, 2015 , the utilization rate of our rental fleet was 69.3% &#32;compared to 76.0% &#32;as of December 31, 2014 . 

Engineered Equipment Sales. This operating unit includes the following components: 

&#8226; 

Compressor fabrication. Fabrication involves the assembly of compressor components manufactured by us or other vendors into compressor units that are ready for rental or sale. In addition to fabricating compressors for our rental fleet, we engineer and fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to customers to meet their specifications based on well pressure, production characteristics and the particular applications for which compression is sought. 

&#8226; 

Compressor manufacturing. We design and manufacture our own proprietary line of reciprocating compressor frames, cylinders and parts known as our &#8220;CiP&#8221;, or Cylinder-in-Plane, product line. We use the finished components to fabricate compressor units for our rental fleet or for sale to customers. We also sell finished components to other fabricators. 

&#8226; 

Flare fabrication. We design, fabricate, sell, install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for the onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases. Applications for this equipment are often environmentally and regulatory driven, and we believe we are a leading supplier to this market. 

&#8226; 

Parts sales and compressor rebuilds. To provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses, we stock varying levels of replacement parts at our Midland, Texas facility and at field service locations. We also provide an exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this part of our business. 

Service and Maintenance. We service and maintain compressors owned by our customers on an &#8220;as needed&#8221; basis. Natural gas compressors require routine maintenance and periodic refurbishing to prolong their useful life. Routine maintenance includes physical and visual inspections and other parametric checks that indicate a change in the condition of the compressors. We perform wear-particle analysis on all packages and perform overhauls on a condition-based interval or a time-based schedule. Based on our past experience, these maintenance procedures maximize component life and unit availability and minimize downtime. 

Business Strategy 

During the downturn in the economy beginning in mid 2008, our strategy was to reduce expenses in line with the lower anticipated business activity, and fabricate compressor equipment only in direct response to market requirements. As the economy recovered, we adjusted this strategy to ensure that we kept pace with growth while balancing appropriate business risk. Entering into 2015 we reinstated our proven strategy of reducing expenses and fabricating on an as needed basis and will continue this strategy in 2016. See &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Our Performance Trends and Outlook" for more information. Our long-term intentions to grow our revenue and profitability are based on the following business strategies: 

&#8226; 

Expand rental fleet . We intend to prudently increase the size of our rental fleet by fabricating compressor units in numbers that correspond to the growth of the market and in relation to market share gains we may experience. We believe our 

growth will continue to be primarily driven through our placement of small to medium horsepower wellhead natural gas compressors for non-conventional natural gas and oil production. 

&#8226; 

Geographic expansion. We will continue to consolidate our operations in existing areas, as well as pursue focused expansion into new geographic regions as opportunities are identified. We presently provide our products and services to a customer base of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming. 

&#8226; 

Expand our &#8216;secondary&#8217; product lines. In addition to our primary rental and engineered product business lines, we will emphasize the growth of our other products, e.g., flares, CiP compressor products and general compressor maintenance and repair services. 

&#8226; 

Selectively pursue acquisitions. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other opportunities that would provide us with access to new markets or enhance our current market position. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe our competitive strengths include: 

&#8226; 

Superior customer service. Our emphasis on the small to medium horsepower markets has enabled us to effectively meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe these markets have been under-serviced by our larger competitors which, coupled with our personalized services and in-depth knowledge of our customers&#8217; operating needs and growth plans, have allowed us to enhance our relationships with existing customers as well as attract new customers. The size, type and geographic diversity of our rental fleet enable us to provide customers with a range of compression units that can serve a wide variety of applications. We are able to select the correct equipment for the job, rather than the customer trying to fit its application to our equipment. 

&#8226; 

Diversified product line. Our compressors are available as high and low pressure rotary screw and reciprocating packages. They are designed to meet a number of applications, including wellhead production, natural gas gathering, natural gas transmission, vapor recovery and gas and plunger lift. In addition, our compressors can be built to handle a variety of gas mixtures, including air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and hydrocarbon gases. A diversified compression product line helps us compete by being able to satisfy widely varying pressure, volume and production conditions that customers encounter. Our "Flare King" product line provides flares and gas incineration devices to the industry for production maintenance and environmental compliance. 

&#8226; 

Purpose-built rental compressors. Our rental compressor packages have been designed and built to address the primary requirements of our customers in the producing regions in which we operate. Our units are compact in design and are easy, quick and inexpensive to move, install and start-up. Our control systems are technically advanced and allow the operator to start and stop our units remotely and/or in accordance with well conditions. We believe our rental fleet is also one of the newest. 

&#8226; 

Experienced management team. On average, each of our executive and operating team members have over 30 years of oilfield services industry experience. We believe our management team has successfully demonstrated its ability to grow our business during times of expansion and to manage through downturns. 

&#8226; 

Broad geographic presence. We presently provide our products and services to a customer base of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming. Our footprint allows us to service many of the natural gas producing regions in the United States. We believe that operating in diverse geographic regions allows us better utilization of our compressors, minimal incremental expenses, operating synergies, volume-based purchasing, leveraged inventories and cross-trained personnel. We also sell engineered compression products to international customers. 

&#8226; 

Long-standing customer relationships. We have developed long-standing relationships providing compression equipment to many major and independent oil and natural gas companies. Our customers generally continue to rent our compressors after the expiration of the initial terms of our rental agreements, which we believe reflects their satisfaction with the reliability and performance of our services and products. 

Major Customers 

&#160; 

Sales and rental income to Devon Energy Production, Inc. ("Devon") and Occidental Permian, LTD. ("Oxy") for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;amounted to 21% &#32;and 10% &#32;of our revenue, respectively. Sales and rental income to Devon and EOG Resources, Inc. ("EOG") in the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;amounted to 18% &#32;and 15% &#32;of our revenue, respectively. Sales and 

rental income to EOG and Devon in the year ended December 31, 2013 &#32;amounted to 18% &#32;and 15% &#32;of our revenue. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% &#32;of our revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

&#160; 

Oxy and Devon amounted to 25% &#32;and 10% &#32;of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015. EOG, Promatcon Tepatguna ("Promatcon") and Oxy amounted to 20%, 18% and 14% &#32;of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 . No other customers amounted to more than 10% &#32;of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . The loss of any of the above customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, depending upon the demand for our compressors at the time of such loss and our ability to attract new customers. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales force pursues the rental and sales market for compressors and flare equipment and other services in their respective territories. Additionally, our personnel coordinate with each other to develop relationships with customers who operate in multiple regions. Our sales and marketing strategy is focused on communication with current customers and potential customers through frequent direct contact, technical assistance, print literature, direct mail and referrals. Our sales and marketing personnel coordinate with our operations personnel in order to promptly respond to and address customer needs. Our overall sales and marketing efforts concentrate on demonstrating our commitment to enhancing the customer&#8217;s cash flow through enhanced product design, fabrication, manufacturing, installation, customer service and support. 

Competition 

We have a number of competitors in the natural gas compression segment, some of which have greater financial resources. We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of price, customer service, including the ability to place personnel in remote locations, flexibility in meeting customer needs, and quality and reliability of our compressors and related services. 

Compressor industry participants can achieve significant advantages through increased size and geographic breadth. As the number of rental compressors in our rental fleet increases, the number of sales, support, and maintenance personnel required and the minimum level of inventory do not increase proportionately. 

Backlog 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a sales backlog of approximately $4.1 million &#32;compared to $5.8 million &#32;as of December 31, 2014 &#32;. We expect to fulfill the backlog in the first half of 2016 . Sales backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or a financing arrangement exists, and delivery is scheduled. In addition, the major components of our compressors are acquired from suppliers through periodic purchase orders that in many instances require three or four months of lead time prior to delivery of the order. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 263 total employees, none of which are represented by a labor union. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

Liability and Other Insurance Coverage 

Our equipment and services are provided to customers who are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, and oil spills. We maintain liability insurance that we believe is customary in the industry and which includes environmental cleanup, but excludes product warranty insurance because the majority of components on our compressor unit are covered by the manufacturers. We also maintain insurance with respect to our facilities. Based on our historical experience, we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate. However, there is a risk that our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that insurance may not cover all losses. In addition, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. 

Government Regulation 

All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including containment and disposal of hazardous materials, oilfield waste, other waste materials and acids. 

To date, we have not been required to expend significant resources in order to satisfy applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future. However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material and we could incur liabilities for noncompliance. 

Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations, which relate to the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase our costs and could have an adverse effect on our operations. The state and federal environmental laws and regulations that currently apply to our operations could become more stringent in the future. 

We have utilized operating and disposal practices that were or are currently standard in the industry. However, materials such as solvents, thinner, waste paint, waste oil, wash down waters and sandblast material may have been disposed of or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control either as to such entities' treatment of materials or the manner in which such materials may have been disposed of or released. 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on: 

&#8226; 

owners and operators of sites, and 

&#8226; 

persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of "hazardous substances" found at sites. 

Waste Management and Disposal 

&#160; 

The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations govern the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. During the course of our operations, we generate wastes (including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, paints, solvents and abrasive blasting materials) in quantities regulated under RCRA. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. CERCLA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations impose strict, and under certain conditions, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and past owners and operators of the facility or disposal site where the release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 

&#160; 

We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, a number of properties that have been used in support of our operations for a number of years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, or other regulated wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal by companies sub-contracted by us. In addition, some of these properties may have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other regulated wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials released or disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate historical property contamination, or to perform certain operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently under any order requiring that we undertake or pay for any cleanup activities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not receive any such order in the future. 

&#160; 

The federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and implementing regulations govern: 

&#8226; 

the prevention of discharges, including oil and produced water spills, and 

&#8226; 

liability for drainage into waters. 

Air Emissions 

Our operations are also subject to federal, state, and local regulations. The Clean Air Act and implementing regulations and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, including requirements related to emissions from certain stationary engines, such as those on our compressor units. These laws and regulations impose limits on the levels of various substances that may be emitted into the atmosphere from our compressor units and require us to meet more stringent air emission standards and install new emission control equipment on all of our engines built after July 1, 2008. In addition, the EPA issued regulations in 2012 that require the reduction of emissions of volatile organic compounds, air toxics and methane, a greenhouse gas, at certain oil and gas operations. We are not currently aware of material impacts to our operations associated with these rules. 

We believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and the phasing in of emission controls and other known regulatory requirements should not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition or operational results. However, it is possible that future developments, such as new or increasingly strict requirements and environmental laws and enforcement policies there under, could lead to material costs of environmental compliance by us. While we may be able to pass on the additional cost of complying with such laws to our customers, there can be no assurance that attempts to do so will be successful. Some risk of environmental liability and other costs are inherent in the nature of our business, however, and there can be no assurance that environmental costs will not rise. 

In recent years, increased concern has been raised over the protection of the environment. Legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced in Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009 and Paris Accord in 2015. Also the EPA has undertaken new efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects. Recently, the EPA declared that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health and proposed to expand its regulations relating to those emissions. To the extent that new laws or other governmental actions restrict the energy industry or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry, we could be adversely affected. We cannot determine to what extent our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations. 

&#160; 

Occupational Safety and Health &#160; 

We are subject to the requirements of Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in compliance with these applicable requirements and with other comparable laws. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

We believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent, trademark, or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of our ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, we may seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements. We do not own any unexpired patents. Although we continue to use the patented technology and consider it useful in certain applications, we do not consider the expired patent to be material to our business as a whole. 

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

Fabrication of our rental compressors involves the purchase by us of engines, compressors, coolers and other components, and the assembly of these components on skids for delivery to customer locations. These major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third-party suppliers on an "as needed" basis, which typically requires a three to four month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules. Although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier, we believe we have adequate alternative sources available. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors. However, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition, particularly if we are unable to increase our rental rates and sale prices proportionate to any such component price increases.

Glossary of Industry Terms 

"CiP" - A branded, proprietary gas compressor product line designed, manufactured and packaged by the Company. The 'Cylinder in Plane' design results in a compact and vibration-free compressor unit that particularly lends itself to unconventional wellhead applications, air compression and compressed natural gas requirements. 

"coal bed methane" &#8211; A natural gas generated during coal formation and provided from coal seams or adjacent sandstones. 

"flare" &#8211; A tall stack equipped with burners used as a safety device at wellheads, refining facilities, gas processing plants, and chemical plants. Flares are used for the combustion and disposal of combustible gases. The gases are piped to a remote, usually elevated, location and burned in an open flame in the open air using a specially designed burner tip, auxiliary fuel, and steam or air. Combustible gases are flared most often due to emergency relief, overpressure, process upsets, startups, shutdowns, and other operational safety reasons. Natural gas that is uneconomical for sale is also flared. Often natural gas is flared as a result of the unavailability of a method for transporting such gas to markets. 

"gas lift" &#8211; A production enhancement technique whereby natural gas is injected into an oil well to increase/improve the oil production. 

"gas shale" &#8211; Fine grained rocks where the predominant gas storage mechanism is absorption and gas is stored in volumes that are potentially economic. 

"oil shale" &#8211; Also referred to as tight oil, is petroleum that consists of light crude oil contained in petroleum-bearing formations of low-permeability, often shale or tight sandstone. 

"reciprocating compressors" &#8211; A reciprocating compressor is a type of compressor which compresses vapor by using a piston in a cylinder and a back-and-forth motion. 

"screw compressors" &#8211; A type of compressor used in low-pressure and vapor compression applications where two intermesh rotors create pockets of continuously decreasing volume, in which the gas is compressed and its pressure is increased. 

"tight gas" &#8211; A gas bearing sandstone or carbonate matrix (which may or may not contain natural fractures) which exhibits a low-permeability (tight) reservoir.
