Most of our asset management businesses, along with our Pershing businesses, are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon. 

Each of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law. 

BNY Mellon&#8217;s branches and subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). &#160; The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (&#8220;BNYMSA&#8221;) is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe.

Supervision and Regulation

Competition 

BNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Investment Management business competes with domestic and international asset management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms, and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers. Our Investment Services business competes with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and cash management services and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, rates, lending limits and customer convenience. 

Many of our competitors, with the particular exception of financial holding companies, banks and trust companies, are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8212; Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section in the Annual Report and, as a result, may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects. 

&#160;

Many broad-based financial services firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage and asset management, which may enhance their competitive position. 

As part of our business strategy, we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients. We also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor, and, for this reason, have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area. 

The ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor, and we have devoted significant resources to being able to implement this. 

For additional discussion regarding competition, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Factors &#8211; We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability&#8221; in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
