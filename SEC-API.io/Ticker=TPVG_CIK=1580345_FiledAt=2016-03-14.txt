 Item 1. 

Business 

Overview 

We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company, or &#8220;BDC,&#8221; under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the &#8220;1940 Act.&#8221; We also have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a regulated investment company, or &#8220;RIC,&#8221; under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the &#8220;Code,&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the &#8220;JOBS Act.&#8221; For so long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 

We were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC&#8217;s investment platform and are the primary vehicle through which TPC focuses its venture growth stage business. Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by primarily lending with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries which are backed by TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors.

We originate and invest primarily in loans that have a secured collateral position and are used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, equipment financings and, on a select basis, revolving loans, together with, in many cases, attached equity &#8220;kickers&#8221; in the form of warrants, and direct equity investments. We underwrite our investments seeking an unlevered yield-to-maturity on our growth capital loans and equipment financings generally ranging from 10% to 18% and on our revolving loans generally ranging from 1% above the applicable prime rate to 10%, in each case, with potential for higher returns in the event we are able to exercise warrants and realize gains or sell our related equity investments at a profit. We also generally underwrite our secured loans seeking a loan-to-enterprise value of less than 25%. 

We make investments that our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team believes have a low probability of loss due to our expertise and the revenue profile, product validation, customer commitments, intellectual property, financial condition and enterprise value of the potential opportunity. We believe these investments provide us with a stable, fixed-income revenue stream along with the potential for equity-related gains on a risk-adjusted basis. We believe that the venture growth stage debt market presents a compelling growth channel for us because it has high barriers to entry and is underserved by both traditional lenders and existing debt financing providers to venture capital-backed companies given the brand, reputation and market acceptance, industry relationships, venture lending and leasing expertise, specialized skills, track record, and other factors required to lend to companies backed by leading venture capital investors. Additionally, we believe our investments are distinct compared with the investments made by more traditional lenders because our investments provide us the ability to invest alongside leading venture capital 

&#160;

investors in companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries. We also believe that our investments are distinct compared to the investments made by existing debt financing providers to venture capital backed companies given our primary focus on venture growth stage companies backed by TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors. 

We believe we are able to successfully structure these investments as a result of the strong value proposition our secured loans offer to both borrowers and their venture capital investors. Our secured loans provide venture growth stage companies with an opportunity to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

diversify their funding sources; 

&#160;

&#183; 

augment their existing capital base and extend operating capital; 

&#160;

&#183; 

scale business operations and accelerate growth; 

&#160;

&#183; 

fund administrative expenses ahead of anticipated corresponding revenue; 

&#160;

&#183; 

expand product offerings through internal development or acquisitions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

lower the upfront costs of capital expenditures; 

&#160;

&#183; 

build and/or expand their leadership positions within their respective markets; 

&#160;

&#183; 

accelerate and/or smooth out the timing of cash collections; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

delay and/or postpone the need for its next round of equity financing, 

in each case, extending its cash available to fund operations without incurring substantial equity dilution during a critical time in their lifecycle when they are meaningfully building enterprise value. 

We commenced investment activities on March 5, 2014. In order to expedite the ramp-up of our investment activities and further our ability to meet our investment objectives, on March 5, 2014, we acquired our initial portfolio. The net consideration paid was approximately $121.7 million which reflected approximately $123.7 million of investments less approximately $2.0 million for the prepaid interest, and the fair value of unfunded commitments. We financed the acquisition of our initial portfolio by using a portion of a $200.0 million credit facility (the &#8220;Bridge Facility&#8221;) provided by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch (&#8220;Deutsche Bank&#8221;). On March 11, 2014, we completed our initial public offering and sold 9,840,665 shares of common stock (including 1,250,000 shares of common stock through the underwriters&#8217; exercise of their overallotment option and the concurrent private placement of 257,332 shares of common stock to our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team and other persons associated with TPC) of our common stock at an offering price of $15.00 per share. We received $141.6 million of net proceeds in connection with the initial public offering and concurrent private placement, net of the portion of underwriting fees and offering costs we paid. We used these net proceeds to pay down all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility and terminated the Bridge Facility in conjunction with such repayment. On March 27, 2015, we priced a public offering of 6,500,000 shares of our common stock, raising approximately $93.7 million after offering costs. On April 29, 2015, we received an additional approximately $2.2 million through the issuance of 154,018 shares of our common stock as the result of underwriters&#8217; partial exercise of their overallotment option. Offering costs of approximately $0.9 million were borne by us and charged against paid-in capital. The Adviser paid approximately $3.7 million, which represents a portion of the market price discount and all of the underwriting sales load, which amount is not subject to recoupment from us.

In February 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Deutsche Bank acting as administrative agent and a lender, and KeyBank National Association, Everbank Commercial Lender Finance, Inc., and AloStar Bank of Commerce, as other lenders, which provided us with a $150.0 million commitment, subject to borrowing base requirements (&#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;). In August 2014, we amended the Credit Facility to increase the total commitments by $50.0 million to $200.0 million in aggregate. Effective as of a January 2016 amendment to the Credit Facility, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) the commercial paper rate for certain specified lenders and 30-day LIBOR for other lenders or, if LIBOR is unavailable, the higher of Deutsche Bank&#8217;s commercial lending rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% plus (ii) a margin of 3.0% during the Credit Facility&#8217;s revolving period. The revolving period under the amended Credit Facility expires in February 2018. 

&#160;

On August 4, 2015, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") and received net proceeds of $48.3 million after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2020 Notes is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, beginning on October 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220; NYSE &#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;TPVZ&#8221;. The 2020 Notes were issued in integral principal amount multiples ("units") of $25. On September 2, 2015, we issued an additional $4.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and received net proceeds of approximately $4.5 million after the payment of fees and offering costs as a result of the underwriters&#8217; partial exercise of their option to purchase additional 2020 Notes. 

TriplePoint Capital, Adviser, and Administrator 

TriplePoint Capital 

TriplePoint Capital is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries. TPC&#8217;s portfolio of venture capital-backed companies included and/or includes widely recognized and industry-leading companies, including, among others, Facebook, YouTube, Bloom Energy, Chegg, Etsy, Gilt Groupe, Oncomed, One Kings Lane, Proteolix, Ring Central, Ruckus Wireless, Segway, Shazam, Splunk, Square, Varonis, and Workday. 

TPC&#8217;s global investment platform serves venture capital-backed companies backed by its select group of leading venture capital investors across all five stages of development of a venture capital-backed company&#8217;s lifecycle with dedicated business segments focused on providing creative, flexible and customized debt financings and complementary services at each stage. In addition, TPC has a business segment targeting equity investing in seed, early and later stage venture capital-backed companies called TriplePoint Ventures. TPC also has a &#8220;fund of funds&#8221; business segment which seeks to selectively invest in venture capital funds established by certain of its select group of leading venture capital investors. 

TPC utilizes a unique, relationship-based lending strategy which primarily targets companies funded by a select group of leading venture capital investors. TPC refers to this approach as the &#8220;TriplePoint Lifespan Approach.&#8221; Key elements of the TriplePoint Lifespan Approach include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

establishing debt financing relationships with select venture capital-backed companies across all five lifecycle stages of development; 

&#160;

&#183; 

working with TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors to identify debt financing opportunities within their portfolio companies that we believe have established management teams, strong investor support, large market opportunities, innovative technology or intellectual property and sufficient cash on hand and equity backing to support a potential debt financing opportunity on attractive risk-adjusted terms; 

&#160;

&#183; 

developing debt financing relationships as early as possible in a venture capital-backed company&#8217;s lifecycle in order to have a real-time understanding of the company&#8217;s capital needs and be in a strategic position to evaluate and capitalize on additional investment opportunities as the company matures; 

&#160;

&#183; 

diligently monitoring the progress and ongoing creditworthiness of a borrower; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

serving as a creative, flexible and dependable financing partner with a focus on efficiency, responsiveness and customer service. 

In February 2014, our Adviser entered into a staffing agreement with TPC (the &#8220;Staffing Agreement&#8221;), under which TPC has made and will continue to make, its investment and portfolio management and monitoring teams available to our Adviser. We believe that the Staffing Agreement (i) provides us with access to deal flow generated by TPC in the ordinary course of its business; (ii) provides us with access to TPC&#8217;s investment professionals, including its senior investment team led by TPC&#8217;s co-founders, Messrs. James P. Labe and Sajal K. Srivastava, and TPC&#8217;s non-investment employees; and (iii) commits certain key senior members of TPC&#8217;s Investment Committee to serve as members of our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee. TPC is obligated under the Staffing Agreement to 

&#160;

allocate investment opportunities among its affiliates fairly and equitably over time in accordance with its allocation policy. Our Adviser is responsible for determining if we will participate in deal flow generated by TPC. Our Adviser takes advantage of the significant deal origination channels, rigorous due diligence process, disciplined underwriting methods, creative investment structuring and hands-on portfolio management and investment monitoring capabilities of TPC&#8217;s senior investment team. 

Our Adviser 

Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser, which is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221; and is a subsidiary of TPC. Our Adviser is responsible for sourcing, reviewing and structuring investment opportunities for us, underwriting and diligencing our investments and monitoring our investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser was organized in August 2013 and, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the &#8220;Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221;), we pay our Adviser a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. Our Adviser has retained Mr. Carl M. Rizzo to act as its Chief Compliance Officer under the terms of an agreement between our Adviser and Alaric Compliance Services LLC. For information regarding our Adviser, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Management Agreements&#8212;Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221; and &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Related Party Agreements and Transactions&#8212;Investment Advisory Agreement.&#8221; 

Our Administrator 

Our administrative functions are provided by our Administrator. Our Administrator is responsible for furnishing us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. In February 2014, we entered into an administration agreement with our Administrator, or the &#8220;Administration Agreement,&#8221; under which we pay our Administrator an amount equal to our allocable portion (subject to the review of our Board) of our Administrator&#8217;s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs associated with performing compliance and financial reporting functions. For information regarding our Administrator, see &#8220;Management Agreements&#8212;Administration Agreement&#8221; and &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Related Party Agreements and Transactions&#8212;Administration Agreement.&#8221; 

Investment Strategy 

Overview 

Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by relying on a core investment philosophy described as the &#8220;Four Rs.&#8221; The Four Rs stand for: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Relationships &#8212;We seek to develop and maintain deep, longstanding and mutually beneficial relationships with TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Reputation &#8212;We seek to preserve and extend the strong reputation of TPC&#8217;s brand and franchise as a creative, flexible and dependable financing partner with a focus on efficiency, responsiveness and customer service when interacting with venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs and when originating, structuring, underwriting and monitoring our investments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

References &#8212;We seek to make every venture capital investor, borrower and entrepreneur with whom we work a reference so that they not only work with us again but encourage others to work with us also. We believe that receiving referrals from TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs is a critical part of our investment origination process and differentiates us from other lenders. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Returns &#8212;We believe that by focusing on relationships, reputation and references, in addition to utilizing our specialized and established credit and monitoring process, we generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. 

&#160;

We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. We also generally underwrite our secured loans seeking a loan-to-enterprise value of less than 25%. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrants that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns. 

Target Venture Growth Stage Companies 

We primarily target investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies backed by venture capital investors. However, having backing from a venture capital investor does not guarantee financing from us. Prospective borrowers must further qualify based on our Adviser&#8217;s rigorous and established investment selection and underwriting criteria and generally have many of the following characteristics: 

&#160;

&#183; 

financing from a member of TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors with whom TPC has an established history of providing secured loans alongside equity investments made by these venture capital investors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

focused in technology, life sciences or other high growth industries and targeting an industry segment with a large and/or growing market opportunity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of their primary technology and product development; 

&#160;

&#183; 

meaningful customer sales, commitments or orders and have generated or we believe are reasonably expected to generate within the current fiscal year or on an annualized run rate at least $20 million in revenues and a strong outlook for continued and/or potentially rapid revenue growth; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a leadership position in its market (or the potential to establish a leadership position) with potential and/or defensible barriers to entry; 

&#160;

&#183; 

an experienced and relatively complete senior management team with a successful track record; 

&#160;

&#183; 

support from existing venture capital investors in the form of meaningful invested equity capital relative to our investment amount and/or reserved capital or willingness to invest additional capital as needed; 

&#160;

&#183; 

strong likelihood of raising additional equity capital or achieving an exit in the form of an initial public offering or sale based on our determination; 

&#160;

&#183; 

differentiated products, unique technology, proprietary intellectual property, and/or positive clinical results that may have intrinsic value on a stand-alone and/or liquidation basis; 

&#160;

&#183; 

meaningful enterprise value relative to the size of our investment as indicated by a recent equity round valuation or as determined by a third-party with, in our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team&#8217;s opinion, the potential for upside; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a balanced current financial condition typically with 12 months or more of operating cash runway based on its projected cash burn and/or a path to profitability typically over a three to five year period from the date of our investment; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

upcoming strategic and potential enterprise valuation-accreting business milestones that our investment can help provide operating cash runway for the company to achieve. 

For many venture capital-backed companies, we believe that the venture growth stage is generally the point in their lifecycle at which they begin operational and financial preparations for a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or private sale. We believe these investments provide us with a stable, fixed-income revenue stream along with the potential for equity-related gains on a risk-adjusted basis. We invest opportunistically in venture capital-backed companies at other lifecycle stages of development when our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team 

&#160;

believes that they present an attractive investment opportunity for us, subject to our compliance with applicable requirements under the 1940 Act. 

Invest with TPC&#8217;s Select Group of Leading Venture Capital Investors 

We generally expect to (i) benefit from the relationships developed by TPC as part of its TriplePoint Lifespan Approach and (ii) target investment opportunities backed by a select group of leading venture capital investors with whom our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team has an established history of providing secured loans alongside equity investments made by these venture capital investors. We believe these well-recognized firms have consistently generated strong returns through superior selection processes and access to experienced entrepreneurs and quality investment opportunities based upon their strong reputations and track records, specialized knowledge and experienced investment professionals. As a result of this strategy, we focus and narrow our investment sourcing efforts to those investment opportunities backed by these leading venture capital investors with established track records targeting investments in Silicon Valley, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Northern Virginia, San Diego, Seattle, the United Kingdom, Israel and other geographic areas of venture capital investments. We believe these relationships serve as an important source of investment opportunity referrals for us. We work with our select group of leading venture capital investors to identify debt financing opportunities within their portfolio companies that we believe have established management teams, strong venture capital investor support, large market opportunities, innovative technology or intellectual property, potential for meaningful warrant and/or equity returns and sufficient cash reserves to complement a potential debt financing opportunity. 

Focus in Technology, Life Sciences and other High Growth Industries 

We generally target technology, life sciences and other high growth industries and further specialize in subsectors within each of these industries including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Technology &#8212;areas of focus include: big data, cloud computing, communications, consumer, data storage, electronics, energy efficiency, hardware, information services, internet and media, networking, semiconductors, software, software as a service, wireless communications and other technology related subsectors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Life Sciences &#8212;areas of focus include: biotechnology, diagnostic testing and bioinformatics, drug delivery, drug discovery, healthcare information systems, healthcare services, medical, surgical and therapeutic devices, pharmaceuticals and other life science related subsectors; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Other High Growth Industries &#8212;areas of focus vary depending upon our Adviser&#8217;s investment strategy. 

Our Adviser seeks to invest in those subsectors where our Adviser sees opportunities for innovation, globalization, demand and other drivers of change create significant business opportunities for venture growth stage companies with cutting edge technology, differentiated value propositions and sustainable competitive advantages. As a result, we believe that companies in these subsectors are more likely to attract significant investment from venture capital investors, private equity firms or strategic partners and are a more attractive candidate for a liquidity event than a company in a non-high growth industry. 

Offer Creative Financing Solutions with Attractive Risk-Adjusted Pricing 

Debt financings for venture growth stage companies are extremely diverse with use of proceeds, repayment structures and value propositions varying considerably among different company types. Our debt financings are customized based on a host of factors, including our review, assessment and analysis of each company&#8217;s management team, business outlook, underlying technology, support from its venture capital investors, products or services, current and future financial profile, intended use of our proceeds and anticipated payback structure, timing of a liquidity event and return potential. The diversity of debt financing possibilities requires prospective lenders to demonstrate a high degree of venture lending and leasing expertise and technology, life sciences and other high growth industries knowledge, specialization, willingness to provide customized products and flexibility. We believe the members of our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team are uniquely situated given their extensive industry background, track record, knowledge and lending experience in the technology, life sciences and other high growth industries, as well as venture capital, private equity and credit, to analyze, structure and underwrite such debt 

&#160;

financings. We believe that we have the ability to appropriately price the investment opportunities we originate based upon the debt structures we employ and the individual risk profiles of our borrowers to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for us and our stockholders. 

Generate Equity Upside over Time through Warrant and Equity Investments 

In connection with our secured loans, we generally receive warrants to acquire preferred or common stock in a venture growth stage company with an exercise price typically equal to the same price per share paid by the company&#8217;s venture capital investors in its last round of equity financing or a recent valuation of the venture growth stage company as determined by a third-party. Our warrant coverage generally ranges from 2% to 10% of the committed loan amount. The warrants we obtain typically include a &#8220;cashless exercise&#8221; provision to allow us to exercise these rights without any additional cash investment. We also generally receive the opportunity to invest equity directly in our venture growth stage companies. We believe that making equity investments and receiving warrants in venture growth stage companies with exit events on the horizon, such as an initial public offering or private sale, increases the likelihood of equity appreciation and enhanced investment returns. As a venture growth stage company&#8217;s enterprise value changes we expect to recognize unrealized gains or losses from the fair value changes in our warrants and equity investments and in conjunction with either a sale of the company or in connection with or following an initial public offering, we expect to achieve additional investment returns and realized gains from the exercise of these warrants and the sale of the underlying stock. 

Utilize a Disciplined Investment Process 

Our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team leverages the more than 25 years of experience and expertise of Mr. Labe, one of TPC&#8217;s co-founders, and the track record developed by Messrs. Labe and Srivastava at TPC since its inception for reviewing prospective borrowers and potential financings, structuring those financings and subsequently monitoring those that are pursued and made, through which our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team has succeeded in making profitable investments and minimizing credit losses. Additionally, we believe that the credit performance of our venture growth stage companies and the returns associated with lending to these companies are enhanced through our Adviser&#8217;s focus on originating investments primarily backed by TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors and having an understanding of their outlook and/or support of our prospective and existing borrowers. 

Employ Active Portfolio Management Processes 

Our Adviser utilizes an extensive internal credit tracking and monitoring approach to regularly follow a venture growth stage company&#8217;s actual financial performance and achievement of business-related milestones to ensure that the internal risk rating assigned to each venture growth stage company investment is appropriate. This process has been refined and validated by Messrs. Labe and Srivastava, TPC&#8217;s co-founders, and the track record developed by TPC since its inception and is based, in part, on its expertise, familiarity and deep understanding of the risk associated with investing in various stages of a venture capital-backed company&#8217;s lifespan. The analysis focuses on both quantitative metrics, such as cash balance and cash burn, and our Adviser&#8217;s qualitative assessment in various areas, such as the outlook for the borrower&#8217;s industry segment, progress of product development, overall adherence to the business plan, financial condition, future growth potential and ability to raise additional equity capital. Our Adviser maintains dialogue and contact with our borrowers&#8217; management teams to discuss, among other topics, business progress, cash flow, financial condition and capital structure issues. Our Adviser also typically engages in dialogue with the venture capital investors in our borrowers to understand and assess the company&#8217;s progress and development and the venture capital investor&#8217;s outlook and/or level of support for our borrower and in conjunction with the Four Rs, our core investment philosophy, determines the appropriate course of action for borrowers on our Credit Watch List. 

Investment Structure 

We offer a full range of creative, flexible and customized secured financing products which may include a combination of an initial facility fee, interest and principal payments, end-of-term payments, warrants and/or equity investment rights. Although the general components for each type of our debt financing products are substantially the same, we select and customize the specific debt financing product on a case-by-case basis based on our 

&#160;

Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team&#8217;s experience and their analysis of a prospective borrower, its financing needs and its intended use of the proceeds from our debt financing product. For example, the type of debt financing transaction, the total repayment period, the interest-only period, the amortization period, the collateral position, the warrant coverage and the overall yield-to-maturity may vary. We make investments that our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team believes have a low probability of loss due to their expertise and the revenue profile, product validation, customer commitments, intellectual property, financial condition and enterprise value of the potential opportunity. Our debt financing products are typically structured as lines of credit, whereby a prospective borrower may be required to draw some of the commitment amount at close but may have up to 18 months from document execution to access the debt financing capital and in limited cases future advances may be subject to certain predetermined performance milestones. 

Growth Capital Loans 

Key typical attributes of our growth capital loans include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Size ranges from $5 million to $50 million. We generally target and balance our growth capital loan size to the total equity capital base, the current or near term enterprise value, revenue run rate and current and near team cash and liquidity profile of a prospective borrower; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Short total repayments typically ranging from 36 to 60 months or less and provide for interest only or moderate loan amortization in the early period of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until 24 to 48 months after the loan&#8217;s funding date or a large lump sum payment on its maturity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Unlevered yield-to-maturity generally ranging from 10% to 18%, which may include current interest payments, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a payment-in-kind (&#8220;PIK&#8221;) interest payment. Our end-of-term payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due at the maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan. A meaningful portion of the difference between our yield-to-maturity and the stated interest rate on the loan is recognized as non-cash income until it is paid; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Equity &#8220;kickers&#8221; in the form of warrants to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Secured by a senior secured lien on all of the prospective borrower&#8217;s assets including a pledge or negative pledge on its intellectual property. For certain prospective borrowers we are the only form of secured debt (other than potentially specific equipment financing). Other prospective borrowers may also have a revolving loan, typically from a bank, to finance receivables, cash, billings, bookings or inventory, and the collateral for such financing may be the underlying financed asset, bank accounts and/or a senior lien in priority to our senior lien. In addition, there may be prospective borrowers that have a term loan facility, with or without an accompanying revolving loan, typically from a bank, that may be in priority to our senior lien; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Limited and/or flexible covenant structures and with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions, restrictions on additional use of leverage, reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third party expenses as well as prepayment penalties. 

Equipment Financings 

Key typical attributes of our equipment financings include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Size ranges from $5 million to $25 million. We generally target the size of our equipment financing to anticipate the capital equipment needs for a prospective borrower over a twelve month period balanced by the total equity capital base, the current or near term enterprise value, revenue run rate and current and near team cash and liquidity profile of a prospective borrower; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Short total repayments typically ranging from 36 to 48 months or less and provide for short interest only periods followed by full amortization; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Structured as full payout loans or leases with either buyout provisions based on the fair market value of the financed equipment or a fixed end-of term payment; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Unlevered yield-to-maturity generally ranging from 10% to 15%, which may include current interest payments, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a PIK interest payment. Our end-of-term payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due at the maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan. The portion of our end-of-term payments which equal the difference between our yield-to-maturity and the stated interest rate on the loan are recognized as non-cash income until they are paid; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Equity &#8220;kickers&#8221; in the form of warrants to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Secured solely by the underlying equipment being financed. We expect that much of the equipment financed by us will consist of standard, off-the-shelf equipment, such as computers, electronic test and measurement, telecommunications, laboratory equipment, manufacturing or production equipment. In certain cases, a portion of an equipment financing may finance customized equipment, software and/or expenses or soft-costs which may not have any substantial resale value; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Limited and/or flexible covenant structures with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions, reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third party expenses as well as prepayment penalties. 

Revolving Loans 

On a select basis we offer revolving loans. Key typical attributes of our revolving loans include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Size ranges from $1 million to $25 million. We generally structure our revolving loans subject to an advance rate against the company&#8217;s inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or equivalent, that serve as our sole or primary collateral in support of the repayment of such loans; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Short total repayments typically ranging from 12 to 36 months or less and typically provide for interest only periods and/or moderate loan amortization in the early period of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until 12 to 24 months after the loan&#8217;s funding date or on its maturity date; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Unlevered yield-to-maturity generally ranging from 1% above the applicable prime rate to 10%, which may include current interest payments, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a PIK interest payment. Our end-of-term payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due at the maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan. The portion of our end-of-term payments which equal the difference between our yield-to-maturity and the stated interest rate on the loan are recognized as non-cash income until they are paid; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Equity &#8220;kickers&#8221; in the form of warrants to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Secured by a senior secured lien on all of the prospective borrower&#8217;s assets including a pledge or negative pledge on its intellectual property or on all of the specific assets financed specifically by the revolving loan such as the company&#8217;s inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or equivalent; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Some financial covenants which may include advance rates, borrowing formulas, excess concentrations, cash requirements, business contracts or milestones along with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions, restrictions on additional use of leverage, reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third party expenses as well as prepayment penalties. 

&#160;

Warrants 

In connection with our secured loans, we generally receive warrants to acquire preferred or common stock in a venture growth stage company typically at the same price per share paid by the company&#8217;s venture capital investors in its last round of equity financing, a recent valuation of the venture growth stage company as determined by a third-party or in its next round of equity financing. As a venture growth stage company&#8217;s enterprise value changes we recognize unrealized gains or losses from the fair value changes in our warrants and in conjunction with either a sale of the company or in connection with or following an initial public offering, we achieve additional investment returns and realized gains from the exercise of these warrants and the sale of the underlying stock. Warrants granted in connection with our secured loans are typically based on a percentage of the committed loan amount, are treated as original issue discount (&#8220;OID&#8221;) and may be earned at document execution and/or as the loan is funded. Warrant coverage generally ranges from 2% to 10% of the committed loan amount. 

Direct Equity Investments 

In connection with our secured loans, we may obtain equity investment rights that allow us to invest in a venture growth stage company&#8217;s current or next round of private equity financing on the same terms and conditions as the company&#8217;s venture capital investors and/or other equity investors in the round. As a venture growth stage company&#8217;s enterprise value changes we recognize unrealized gains or losses from the fair value changes in our direct equity investments and in conjunction with either a sale of the company or in connection with or following an initial public offering, we achieve additional investment returns and realized gains from the sale of the underlying stock. These equity investment rights typically range from $100,000 to $5 million in size (generally not exceeding 5% of the company&#8217;s total equity), although we are under no obligation to make any such investment. Typically, these are passive investments (we do not take a board of directors seat in the company) but can be strategically valuable and beneficial as an enhancement to our relationship with the venture growth stage company and to our economic return by generating meaningful return on capital committed. 

Investment Criteria 

Our Adviser (i) benefits from the relationships developed by TPC as part of its TriplePoint Lifespan Approach and (ii) typically sources investment opportunities with TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors or directly from prospective borrowers who are seeking debt financing. Many of these prospective borrowers are attracted to TPC&#8217;s reputation, extensive track record in the venture growth stage debt market, Four Rs&#8217; core investment philosophy, and/or may have previously had a lending relationship with TPC. Additional origination sources for our Adviser include an extensive network of strategic industry contacts, including former and current venture growth stage companies, financial advisers, commercial banks and accounting and law firms. Our Adviser also identifies companies with strong management teams and innovative technology to proactively generate debt financing opportunities. 

&#160;

We primarily target investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies backed by venture capital investors. However, having backing from a venture capital investor does not guarantee financing from us. Prospective borrowers must further qualify based on our Adviser&#8217;s rigorous and established investment selection and underwriting criteria and generally have many of the following characteristics: 

&#160;

&#183; 

financing from a member of TPC&#8217;s select group of leading venture capital investors with whom TPC has an established history of providing secured loans alongside equity investments made by these venture capital investors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

focused in technology, life sciences or other high growth industries and targeting an industry segment with a large and/or growing market opportunity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of their primary technology and product development; 

&#160;

&#183; 

meaningful customer sales, commitments or orders and have generated or we believe are reasonably expected to generate within the current fiscal year or on an annualized run rate at least $20 million in revenues and a strong outlook for continued and/or potentially rapid revenue growth; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a leadership position in its market (or the potential to establish a leadership position) with potential and/or defensible barriers to entry; 

&#160;

&#183; 

an experienced and relatively complete senior management team with a successful track record; 

&#160;

&#183; 

support from existing venture capital investors in the form of meaningful invested equity capital relative to our investment amount and/or reserved capital or willingness to invest additional capital as needed; 

&#160;

&#183; 

strong likelihood of raising additional equity capital or achieving an exit in the form of an initial public offering or sale based on our determination; 

&#160;

&#183; 

differentiated products, unique technology, proprietary intellectual property, and/or positive clinical results that may have intrinsic value on a stand-alone and/or liquidation basis; 

&#160;

&#183; 

meaningful enterprise value relative to the size of our investment as indicated by a recent equity round valuation or as determined by a third-party with, in our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team&#8217;s opinion, the potential for upside; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a balanced current financial condition typically with 12 months or more of operating cash runway based on its projected cash burn and/or a path to profitability typically over a three to five year period from the date of our investment; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

upcoming strategic and potential enterprise valuation-accreting business milestones that our investment can help provide operating cash runway for the company to achieve. 

We underwrite our transactions to ensure that our customers have a strategic and balanced intended use of our investment proceeds without us taking excessive risk and with a low likelihood of default. We believe that the profiles of the venture growth stage companies that we target mitigate our risk because we expect these companies have several options to repay our debt financing through: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

cash flow either from achieving the strong and rapid revenue and profitability plans targeted at the time of our underwriting or in a downside risk scenario from reducing growth and associated operating expenses; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

receiving additional cash from new equity investors based on the progress and development made by the company and their outlook for growth or in a downside risk scenario from existing equity investors to avoid them from otherwise losing all of their invested capital given our ability to foreclose on our collateral; 

&#160;

&#183; 

receiving acquisition offers from strategic or other financial investors or undertaking an initial public offering, given their large and growing market opportunities, the stage of development of their underlying technology and products and their financial profile; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

in a worst case scenario, liquidating underlying assets including any proceeds from the sale of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and/or intellectual property. 

Upon referral or contact, a prospective borrower is added to our Adviser&#8217;s on-line client management system and assigned to one of our Adviser&#8217;s Originations professionals who becomes the prospective borrower&#8217;s primary contact with us. The Originations professional evaluates the prospective borrower in more depth to understand its debt financing needs and to determine whether or not it is qualified under our criteria. Upon initial screening, the Originations professional generally meets with the prospective borrower and performs a preliminary investigation of the prospective borrower&#8217;s management, operations and business outlook. The Originations professional generally consults with, and gathers information from, a wide variety of industry sources to assess the prospective borrower and its industry. In addition, the Originations professional may reach out to the prospective borrower&#8217;s venture capital investors to understand the background of their investment in the company, their outlook for the company, the company&#8217;s market and products, the company&#8217;s goals and objectives associated with the proposed debt financing and the venture capital investor&#8217;s level of support for the company. If the Originations professional is satisfied with the preliminary assessment of the prospective borrower&#8217;s management, operations and business prospects, the Originations professional submits an internal pre-screen memorandum of the proposed debt transaction to our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team for discussion and review, as well as for pricing and structuring guidance. Each potential investment opportunity that our Adviser&#8217;s Originations professionals determine merits investment consideration is presented and evaluated at a weekly meeting in which our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team discusses the merits and risks of a potential investment opportunity, as well as the due diligence process and the pricing and structure. If our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team believes an investment opportunity fits our investment profile, the Originations professional submits a non-binding term sheet to the prospective borrower. 

Diligence Process 

Assuming the non-binding term-sheet submitted to the prospective borrower is subsequently executed, the investment opportunity is then subject to our Adviser&#8217;s rigorous diligence and credit analysis process, which is based on its senior investment team&#8217;s extensive experience and tailored specifically for venture growth stage companies. This process differs notably from traditional lending analysis, combining both qualitative and quantitative analysis and assessment, versus traditional, purely quantitative credit analyses. There is a heavy orientation towards a qualitative and subjective investment-oriented review, taking into account such factors as: 

&#160;

&#183; 

investor quality, track record and expected level of participation in future financing events; 

&#160;

&#183; 

management team experience, completeness, performance to date, and ability to perform; 

&#160;

&#183; 

industry segment/market attractiveness and outlook, competitive dynamics, and growth potential; 

&#160;

&#183; 

detailed assessment and analysis of the venture growth stage company&#8217;s current products or technology and future products or technology, including value proposition and return on investment to its customers and its ability to expand and grow its customer base; 

&#160;

&#183; 

current and future financial position, including financial projections and sensitivity analyses, historical performance, cash balance and burn analysis, capitalization structure, feasibility of financial plan and underlying assumptions, break-even/profitability timing, future cash needs and future financing plans; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

stage of development and execution timeline and milestones and the likelihood and feasibility of achieving such milestones; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

transaction risk/return profile&#8212;assessing the strengths, weaknesses, risks, loan-to-value, liquidation values and outlook of the borrower compared to the structure, pricing, potential returns, likelihood of repayment and collateral structure of the proposed debt financing. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s diligence and credit analysis process typically includes on-site visits by one of our Adviser&#8217;s Investment and Credit Analysis professionals to a prospective borrower&#8217;s headquarters and other facilities, interviews with key management and board members and reference checks on senior management. In addition, the diligence process may include discussions with key industry research analysts, other industry participants, customers and suppliers, where appropriate. One of our Adviser&#8217;s professionals also typically reviews the prospective borrower&#8217;s organizational documents and structure, capital structure, assets, liabilities, employee plans, key customer or supplier contracts, legal and tax matters and other relevant legal documentation. The Investment and Credit Analysis professional submits a detailed credit and due diligence memorandum describing and analyzing the proposed transaction, as well as the outcome of the diligence and credit analysis activities. This memorandum is circulated to members of our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee in advance of its meetings. 

Investment Committee 

The objective of our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee is to leverage its members&#8217; broad historical experience, including significant entrepreneurial, credit, venture capital, venture lending and leasing expertise and technology, life sciences and other high growth industries knowledge assessing the risk and needs of venture growth stage companies and appropriateness of prospective transactions, assessing the risk/return profile of proposed transactions, assessing the independent diligence and credit analysis and providing a forum for independent and unbiased thought, discussion, and assessment. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee is comprised of Messrs. Labe and Srivastava. Some or all of the members of our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team are asked to attend the Investment Committee meeting and are asked for a &#8220;vote,&#8221; which the Investment Committee members use as a factor in the formal Investment Committee vote. The Investment Committee meets weekly and more frequently on an as-needed basis. The applicable Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis professional presents the transaction, results of the professional&#8217;s diligence review and credit analysis and the professional&#8217;s recommendations to the Investment Committee. During the presentation, Investment Committee members typically ask questions, ask for clarifications, state opinions and assessments and make other comments. When there are no further questions and the discussions have concluded, the Investment Committee holds a vote and approves the proposed transaction if it receives unanimous consent from all of the Investment Committee members. In certain situations, the Investment Committee may ask the Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis professional to perform additional analysis and resubmit the transaction at a later Investment Committee meeting. No single criterion determines a decision to invest. The Investment Committee members weigh all the factors, both qualitative and quantitative, when making an investment decision. Our Adviser has the discretion to modify the members of the Investment Committee and its approval process at any time without our consent. 

Investment Monitoring and Portfolio Management 

Our Adviser utilizes an extensive internal credit tracking and monitoring approach to follow a borrower&#8217;s actual financial performance and achievement of business-related milestones to ensure that the internal risk rating assigned to each borrower is appropriate. This process has been refined and validated by Messrs. Labe and Srivastava, TPC&#8217;s co-founders, and the track record developed by TPC since its inception and is based in part on its expertise and deep understanding of the risk associated with investing in various stages of a venture capital-backed company&#8217;s lifespan. The analysis focuses on both quantitative metrics, such as cash balance and cash burn, and our Adviser&#8217;s qualitative assessment in various areas, such as the progress of product development, overall adherence to the business plan, future growth potential and ability to raise additional equity capital. Our Adviser maintains dialogue and contact with our borrowers&#8217; management teams to discuss, among other topics, business progress, cash flow, financial condition and capital structure issues. Our Adviser also typically engages in dialogue with the 

&#160;

venture capital investors in our borrowers to understand and assess the company&#8217;s progress and development and the venture capital investor&#8217;s outlook and/or level of support for our borrower. 

Each of our borrowers is assigned a &#8220;Customer Team&#8221; consisting of staff from our Adviser&#8217;s Originations, Investment and Credit Analysis, Customer Monitoring and Legal teams. We believe having a dedicated Customer Team for each borrower further strengthens the relationship we have with the borrower, which is a key component of our Adviser&#8217;s strategy and affords our Adviser consistent and continuous interaction with our borrowers. A Customer Monitoring professional is assigned to all borrowers to ensure compliance with financial statement reporting, insurance filing and timely payment requirements. These professionals review the various financial statements, compliance reports and other documents received from our borrowers on a monthly or quarterly basis, as well as publicly filed financing statements, such as UCC financing statements and press releases, and enter them into our Adviser&#8217;s online platform for review by the rest of the Customer Team. In the event of a missed payment or if other credit issues arise, the Customer Monitoring professional contacts other members of the Customer Team to initiate escalation procedures. 

On a weekly basis, our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee and our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team review material events and information on our borrowers and discuss in detail those borrowers that are performing below expectations. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently as needed, our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis undertakes an extensive re-evaluation of each borrower and prepares a portfolio update. Key topics that are reviewed include timing/status of the next equity financing round, cash balance and burn rate, financial and operational progress, and covenant adherence. All of these meetings are attended by each member of our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee, senior investment team and the Customer Team for the specific borrower being reviewed. 

If the outlook for a borrower, its industry or a borrower&#8217;s available cash balance or credit rating is deteriorating, or there is material downturn in the borrower&#8217;s standing since our last review, we change the standing of the borrower on our Credit Watch List and our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis professionals contact the borrower and its venture capital investors to discuss and understand any changes. Our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis professionals generally actively work to maintain an open dialogue with borrowers on the Credit Watch List to work to limit the likelihood of a default. Utilizing the Four Rs, our core investment philosophy, our Adviser assesses each borrower on our Credit Watch List and, based on the recommendations from our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis professionals and potentially from our discussions with and representations made from the borrower&#8217;s venture capital investors, determines the appropriate course of action, including decisions to enforce our rights and remedies, modify or waive a provision of our investments, declare a default, request early pay-off, or wait for an external event, such as an acquisition or financing, to restructure a secured loan or receive additional consideration in the form of fees or warrants. In a worst case scenario, a member of our Customer Team sells collateral with the help of management, repossesses and auctions assets or negotiates and structures other potential outcomes. If bankruptcy is a possibility, a member of our Customer Team may utilize outside counsel to provide advice on avoiding this outcome or to minimize the adverse effects on us. 

&#160;

Consistent with TPC&#8217;s existing policies, our Adviser maintains a Credit Watch List with borrowers placed into five groups based upon our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team&#8217;s judgment, where 1 is the highest rating and all new loans are generally assigned a rating of 2.

As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 2.23 and 2.06, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were five 

&#160;

changes within the credit categories. One borrower with a principal balance of $5.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1). One borrower with a principal balance of $6.9 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3). Two borrowers, Virtual Instruments Corporation with principal balance of $25.6 million and Mind Candy Limited with principal balance of $10.0 million, were downgraded from Yellow (3) to Orange (4). The o ther downgrade include d the debt investments that were initially to Coraid, Inc., which were assumed by Intermodal Data, Inc. as part of the foreclosure agreement it entered into to purchase certain assets and assume the outstanding obligations owed to us. The debt investment to Intermodal Data, Inc. was ranked as Orange (4) as of December 31, 2015 . 

During the period from March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2014, there were four changes within the credit categories. Two borrowers were moved to Clear (1) from White (2) and one subsequently paid off its loans and is no longer in our portfolio. Two borrowers were moved to Yellow (3) from White (2). 

SBIC 

We intend to apply, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, for a Small Business Investment Company, or &#8220;SBIC,&#8221; license from the U.S. Small Business Administration, or &#8220;SBA,&#8221; as we believe that it will further our investment strategy and enhance our returns. The SBIC subsidiary would be allowed to issue SBA-guaranteed debentures up to a maximum of $150 million under current SBIC regulations, subject to required capitalization of the SBIC subsidiary and other requirements. SBA guaranteed debentures generally have longer maturities and lower interest rates than other forms of debt that may be available to us, and we believe therefore would represent an attractive source of debt capital. We cannot provide any assurance that the SBA will approve our application to form an SBIC subsidiary if and when we apply for it. 

Competition 

Debt financing for venture capital-backed companies is particularly heterogeneous&#8212;the type, structures and sizes of debt financings often vary significantly depending on a particular company&#8217;s industry and its current or near-term stage of development. The profile and underwriting characteristics of an early stage venture capital-backed company are very different from those of a later stage venture capital-backed company and/or those of a venture growth stage company. Furthermore, within venture growth stage companies, the uses, structures and value propositions of debt financing vary considerably among companies and industries and require a high degree of venture lending and leasing expertise and technology, life sciences and other high growth industries knowledge, specialization and flexibility from a lender. The availability of debt financing for venture growth stage companies is further limited by factors such as the brand, reputation and market acceptance, industry relationships, track record, and other factors required to lend to companies backed by leading venture capital investors, in addition to the distinct credit profiles of these companies and the deep experience and specialized set of skills required to (i) source deal flow and receive investment referrals; (ii) evaluate high growth industries and sectors, business prospects, operating characteristics and collateral; (iii) analyze potential transactions; and (iv) customize unconventional transaction structures for these companies. 

We believe that venture-oriented banks tend to be the primary form of traditional lenders participating in the market for venture growth stage companies and that they generally focus on providing lower risk and lower return financings, which tend to require and impose many restrictive covenants and conditions on borrowers, such as limitations on outflows and borrowing formulas and requiring a significant depository relationship to facilitate rapid liquidation. In addition, we believe that most existing non-traditional debt providers do not regularly or actively participate in venture growth stage lending due to their reluctance to underwrite the large financings required by venture growth stage companies, as well as the desire of these providers to structure deals with lower current return but with the potential for significantly higher equity upside through warrants by lending to companies with lower valuations than would be possible in the venture growth stage lending market. As a result, most existing providers of debt financing tend to focus on seed, early and late stage venture capital-backed companies instead of venture growth stage companies. 

Our competitors include both existing and newly formed equity and debt focused public and private funds, other BDCs, investment banks, venture-oriented banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially 

&#160;

larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, we believe some of our competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which expose them to a wider variety of investments. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 

We believe we compete effectively with these entities primarily on the basis of TPC&#8217;s reputation, track record, experience, industry knowledge and relationships and our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team&#8217;s contacts, efficient investment analysis, decision-making processes, creative financing products and highly customized investment terms. We believe that the Four Rs, our core investment philosophy, enable us to continue to grow our brand name reputation and differentiate us from our competitors. We do not compete primarily on the financing terms we offer and believe that some competitors make loans with rates that are comparable or lower than our rates. We also believe that our relationship-based approach to investing, which leverages our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team&#8217;s expertise in developing strong relationships with venture capital investors and venture capital-backed companies, understanding the capital needs of venture growth stage companies, structuring and customizing attractive financing solutions to meet the financing needs throughout a company&#8217;s growth stage, enables us to identify, attract and proactively capitalize on venture growth stage companies&#8217; debt needs as they grow and become successful enterprises. 

Employees 

We do not have any employees as our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Adviser. We reimburse our Administrator for our allocable portion of expenses incurred pursuant to our Administration Agreement. 

Management Agreements 

Investment Advisory Agreement 

Subject to the overall supervision of our Board and in accordance with the 1940 Act, our Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser: 

&#160;

&#183; 

determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 

&#160;

&#183; 

identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; 

&#160;

&#183; 

executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make; 

&#160;

&#183; 

determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performs due diligence on prospective investments; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. 

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Adviser a fee for its investment advisory and management services consisting of two components&#8212;a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are ultimately borne by our stockholders. 

Base Management Fee 

The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our average adjusted gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of our two most recently completed calendar quarters. Such amount is 

&#160;

appropriately adjusted (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter) for any share issuances or repurchases during a calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro-rated. 

Incentive Fee 

The incentive fee, which provides our Adviser with a share of the income that it generates for us, consists of two components&#8212;investment income and capital gains&#8212;which are largely independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not payable. 

Under the investment income component, we pay our Adviser each quarter 20.0% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision pursuant to which our Adviser receives all of such income in excess of the 2.0% level but less than 2.5% and subject to a total return requirement. The effect of the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is that, subject to the total return provision discussed below, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter, our Adviser receives 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the 2.0% hurdle rate did not apply. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent that 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since the effective date of our election to be regulated as a BDC (March 5, 2014) exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014. In other words, any investment income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle, subject to the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014. For the foregoing purpose, the &#8220;cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations&#8221; is the sum of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses since March 5, 2014. 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the total return requirement described in the preceding paragraph. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuance or repurchase during the current quarter. 

&#160;

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee. 

Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

&#160;

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to first component of incentive fee 

Under the capital gains component of the incentive fee, we pay our Adviser at the end of each calendar year 20.0% of our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of that year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized losses through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the foregoing purpose, our &#8220;aggregate cumulative realized capital gains&#8221; does not include any unrealized gains. It should be noted that we accrue an incentive fee for accounting purposes taking into account any unrealized gains in accordance with GAAP. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee is payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date is treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. 

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 

Example 1: Income Portion of Incentive Fee before Total Return Requirement Calculation: 

Assumptions 

&#160;

&#183; 

Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0% 

(1) 

Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Base management fee(2) = 0.4375% 

(2) 

Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 

(3) 

Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 

Alternative 1 

Additional Assumptions 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8211; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.6125% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. 

&#160;

Alternative 2 

Additional Assumptions 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.90% 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8211; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.2625% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee 

Incentive Fee = (100% &#215; &#8220;Catch-Up&#8221;) + (the greater of 0% AND (20.0% &#215; (pre-incentive fee net investment income &#8211; 2.0%))) 

= (100% &#215; (2.2625% &#8211; 2.0%)) + 0% 

= 100% &#215; 0.2625% 

= 0.2625% 

Alternative 3 

Additional Assumptions 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8211; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee 

Incentive Fee = (100% &#215; &#8220;Catch-Up&#8221;) + (the greater of 0% AND (20.0% &#215; (pre-incentive fee net investment income &#8211; 2.5%))) 

= (100% &#215; (2.5% &#8211; 2.0%)) + (20.0% &#215; (2.8625% &#8211; 2.5%)) 

= 0.5% + (20.0% &#215; 0.3625%) 

= 0.5% + 0.0725% 

= 0.5725% 

Example 2: Income Portion of Incentive Fee with Total Return Requirement Calculation: 

Assumptions 

&#160;

&#183; 

Hurdle rate(4) = 2.0% 

(4) 

Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Base management fee(5) = 0.4375% 

(5) 

Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(6) = 0.2% 

(6) 

Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014 = $9,000,000 

&#160;

Alternative 1 

Additional Assumptions 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8211; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625% 

&#160;

&#183; 

20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 = $8,000,000 

Although our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% (as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above), no incentive fee is payable because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 did not exceed the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014. 

Alternative 2 

Additional Assumptions 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8211; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625%. 

&#160;

&#183; 

20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 = $10,000,000 

Because our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% and because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 exceeds the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014, an incentive fee would be payable, as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above.

Year 1: None 

&#160;

&#183; 

Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%)

&#183; 

Year 1: None 

&#160;

&#183; 

Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $5 million; 20.0% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital loss on Investment B) 

&#160;

&#183; 

Year 3: Capital gains incentive fee of $1.4 million; $6.4 million (20.0% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital loss on Investment B)) less $5 million capital gains fee received in Year 2

Duration and Termination 

Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if (i) (A) approved annually by our Board or (B) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and (ii) approved by a majority of our directors who are not &#8220;interested persons.&#8221; The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by our Adviser and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon 60 days&#8217; written notice. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Relating to our Business and Structure&#8212;We are dependent upon our executive officers and our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team and members of its Investment Committee, in particular, Messrs. Labe and Srivastava, for our success and upon our Adviser&#8217;s access to such individuals pursuant to the Staffing Agreement. If our Adviser were to lose such access, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.&#8221; 

The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser and its professionals and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Adviser&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 

&#160;

Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 

The Investment Advisory Agreement between us and our Adviser was initially approved by our Board at an in-person meeting in November 2013 and entered into in February 2014. Our Board determined to re-approve the Investment Advisory Agreement at an in-person meeting held in January 2016. In reaching a decision to re-approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by the Adviser; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the Company&#8217;s performance relative to comparable business development companies managed by other advisers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the advisory fee structures or similar expenses of comparable externally managed business development companies that engage in similar investing activities; 

&#160;

&#183; 

any breakpoints under the Investment Advisory Agreement and economies of scale; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our historical and projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to business development companies with similar investment objectives; 

&#160;

&#183; 

any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Adviser or the Administrator from their relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships, including through the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the organizational capability, financial condition and profitability of the Adviser and its affiliates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third party service providers or through an internally managed structure; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

various other matters. 

Based on the information reviewed and the discussions detailed above, the Board, including all of the directors who are not &#8220;interested persons&#8221; as defined in the 1940 Act, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services provided and re-approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. The Board did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. Individual members of the Board may have given different weights to different factors.

Administration Agreement 

The Administration Agreement provides that our Administrator is responsible for furnishing us with office facilities and equipment and providing us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, our Administrator performs, or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority. In addition, our Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, our Administrator also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. 

Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount equal to our allocable portion (subject to the review of our Board) of our Administrator&#8217;s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our 

&#160;

portfolio companies, our Administrator is paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such companies for providing this assistance. The Administration Agreement between us and the Administrator was initially approved by our Board at an in-person meeting in November 2013 and was entered into in February 2014. Our Board determined to re-approve the Administration Agreement at an in-person meeting held in January 2016. The Administration Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if (i) (A) the approval of our Board or (B) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and (ii) the approval by a majority of our directors who are not &#8220;interested persons.&#8221; The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. Stockholder approval is not required to amend the Administration Agreement. 

The Administration Agreement provides that, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our Administrator and any person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Administrator&#8217;s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator. 

Pursuant to a sub-administration agreement, our Administrator has engaged Conifer Asset Solutions LLC to provide certain administrative services to us on behalf of our Administrator. 

Staffing Agreement 

In February 2014, our Adviser entered into the Staffing Agreement with TPC. Pursuant to the Staffing Agreement, TPC has made and will continue to make, subject to the terms of the Staffing Agreement, its investment and portfolio management and monitoring teams available to our Adviser. We believe that the Staffing Agreement (i) provides us with access to deal flow generated by TPC in the ordinary course of its business; (ii) provides us with access to TPC&#8217;s investment professionals, including its senior investment team led by Messrs. Labe and Srivastava, and TPC&#8217;s non-investment employees; and (iii) commits certain key senior members of TPC&#8217;s Investment Committee to serve as members of our Adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee. Our Adviser is responsible for determining if we will participate in deal flow generated by TPC. Our Adviser takes advantage of the significant deal origination channels, rigorous due diligence process, disciplined underwriting methods, creative investment structuring and hands-on portfolio management and investment monitoring capabilities of TPC&#8217;s senior investment team. The Staffing Agreement may be terminated with 60 days&#8217; prior written notice. 

License Agreement 

In February 2014, we entered into the License Agreement with TPC under which TPC granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#8220;TriplePoint&#8221; and the TriplePoint logo. Under the License Agreement, we have a right to use the &#8220;TriplePoint&#8221; name for so long as our Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the &#8220;TriplePoint&#8221; name. The License Agreement remains in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser is in effect. 

Determination of Net Asset Value 

Determinations in Connection with our Investments 

We determine the net asset value per share of our common stock quarterly. The net asset value per share is equal to the value of our total assets minus liabilities and any preferred stock outstanding divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, we do not have any preferred stock outstanding. 

Our investment assets are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value is as determined in good faith by our Board. Our 

&#160;

investments are primarily made to venture growth stage companies in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries. Given the nature of lending to these types of companies, our investments are generally considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investments to be traded or exchanged. As such, we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to a consistent valuation policy and our Board in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820 and the 1940 Act. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by our Board may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 

The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by one or more independent valuation firms each quarter. When an external event with respect to one of our portfolio companies, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. 

We have adopted ASC Topic 820. ASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Level 1 &#8212;Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Level 2 &#8212;Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Level 3 &#8212;Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models and other similar valuations techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation. 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment&#8217;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. 

Under ASC Topic 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset, which may be a hypothetical market, and excludes transaction costs. The principal market for any asset is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for such asset in which the reporting entity would or could sell or transfer the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability under ASC Topic 820, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to such market as of the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact. 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by our Adviser&#8217;s professionals that are responsible for the portfolio investment; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Valuation Committee then reviews these preliminary valuations; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. However, our Board does not have de minimis investments of less than 1.0% of our gross assets (up to an aggregate of 10.0% of our gross assets) independently reviewed; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Board then discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and our Valuation Committee. 

Determinations in Connection with our Offerings 

In connection with each offering of shares of our common stock, our Board or an authorized committee thereof is required by the 1940 Act to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below our then current net asset value at the time at which the sale is made. Our Board or an authorized committee thereof considers the following factors, among others, in making such determination: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our management&#8217;s assessment of whether any material change in the net asset value has occurred (including through the realization of net gains on the sale of our investments) from the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value per share of our common stock and ending as of a time within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the sale of our common stock; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our Board or an authorized committee thereof has determined reflects the current (as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays) net asset value of our common stock, which is based upon the net asset value disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management&#8217;s assessment of any material change in the net asset value since the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value, and (ii) the offering price of the shares of our common stock in the proposed offering. 

Moreover, to the extent that there is even a remote possibility that we may (i) issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made or (ii) trigger the undertaking (which we provided to the SEC) to suspend the offering of shares of our common stock if the net asset value fluctuates by certain amounts in certain circumstances, our Board or an authorized committee thereof will elect, in the case of clause (i) above, either to postpone the offering until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to determine net asset value within two days prior to any such sale to ensure that such sale will not be below our then current net asset value, and, in the case of clause (ii) above, to comply with such undertaking or to undertake to determine net asset value to ensure that such undertaking has not been triggered. 

These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records are made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records are maintained with other records we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

Taxation of the Company 

We have elected to be treated and intend to qualify each year as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute (or are deemed to timely distribute) to our stockholders as dividends. 

To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things: 

&#160;

&#183; 

derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign 

&#160;

&#160;

currencies, other income derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership,&#8221; or &#8220;QPTP,&#8221; hereinafter the &#8220;90% Gross Income Test;&#8221; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year: 

&#160;

&#183; 

at least 50% of the value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. Government securities, the securities of other RICs, and other securities, with other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and 

&#160;

&#183; 

not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer (other than U.S. Government securities and the securities of other regulated investment companies), the securities of any two or more issuers that we control and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more QPTPs, the Diversification Tests. 

In the case of a RIC that furnishes capital to development corporations, there is an exception relating to the Diversification Tests described above. This exception is available only to RICs which the SEC determines to be principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, which we refer to as &#8220;SEC Certification.&#8221; We have not sought SEC Certification, but it is possible that we will seek SEC Certification in future years. If we receive SEC Certification, we generally will be entitled to include, in the computation of the 50% value of our assets (described above), the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not we own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer, if the basis of the securities, when added to our basis of any other securities of the issuer that we own, does not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. 

As a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders in any taxable year with respect to which we distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of the sum of our (i) investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net realized short-term capital gains over net realized long-term capital losses and other taxable income (other than any net capital gain), reduced by deductible expenses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends and distributions paid and (ii) net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions), (the &#8220;Annual Distribution Requirement&#8221;). We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. Generally, if we fail to meet this Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we will fail to qualify as a RIC for such taxable year. Although we may meet our Annual Distribution requirement, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, unless we timely distribute (or are deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of: 

&#160;

&#183; 

at least 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 

&#160;

&#183; 

at least 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and 

&#160;

&#183; 

certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. 

While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in order to avoid imposition of this 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may choose to retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, and pay the associated federal corporate income tax, including the 4% U.S. federal excise tax described below. We also may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 

We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while any senior securities are 

&#160;

outstanding unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios. See &#8220;&#8212;Regulation&#8212;Senior Securities.&#8221; Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions. 

Taxation of Company Investments 

Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (iii) convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% Gross Income Test. We monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and to prevent disqualification of us as a RIC but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. 

Debt Instruments . In certain circumstances, we may be required to recognize taxable income prior to which we receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with an end-of-term payment and/or PIK interest payment or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in taxable income each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

Warrants. Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally are treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term generally depends on how long we held a particular warrant. 

Foreign Investments. In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. We do not expect to satisfy the requirement to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us. 

Passive Foreign Investment Companies. We may invest in the stock of a foreign corporation which is classified as a &#8220;passive foreign investment company&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code), or &#8220;PFIC.&#8221; In general, unless a special tax election has been made, we are required to pay tax at ordinary income rates on any gains and &#8220;excess distributions&#8221; with respect to PFIC stock as if such items had been realized ratably over the period during which we held the PFIC stock, plus an interest charge. Certain adverse tax consequences of a PFIC 

&#160;

investment may be limited if we are eligible to elect alternative tax treatment with respect to such investment. No assurances can be given that any such election will be available or that, if available, we will make such an election. 

Foreign Currency Transactions. Under the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates which occur between the time we accrue income or other receivables or accrue expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such receivables or pay such liabilities generally are treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, on disposition of debt instruments and certain other instruments denominated in a foreign currency, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations if the value of the foreign currency between the date of acquisition of the instrument and the date of disposition also are treated as ordinary gain or loss. These currency fluctuations related gains and losses may increase or decrease the amount of our investment company taxable income to be distributed to our stockholders as ordinary income. 

Failure to Qualify as a RIC 

If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and if certain cure provisions described below are not available, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to such dividend; non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as &#8220;qualified dividend income,&#8221; which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets ( i.e. , the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next ten years.

Regulation 

We are a BDC under the 1940 Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors of a BDC be persons other than &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC without the approval of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company in excess of the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. None of the policies in this paragraph is fundamental and each may be changed without stockholder approval. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC&#8217;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets are the following: 

&#160;

(1) 

securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio 

&#160;

&#160;

company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An &#8220;eligible portfolio company&#8221; is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that: &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

&#160;

&#183; 

is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfies either of the following: 

&#160;

i. 

does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a $250 million market capitalization maximum; or 

&#160;

ii. 

is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. 

&#160;

(2) 

securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 

&#160;

(3) 

securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 

&#160;

(4) 

cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. 

The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 

We look through our subsidiaries to the underlying holdings (considered together with portfolio assets held outside of our subsidiaries) for purposes of determining compliance with the 70% qualifying assets requirement of the 1940 Act. On a consolidated basis, at least 70% of our assets will be eligible assets. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of its securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as &#8220;temporary investments,&#8221; so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at 

&#160;

a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the &#8220;Diversification Tests,&#8221; in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser monitors the creditworthiness of any counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. We consolidate our financial results with all of our wholly owned subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and measure our compliance with the leverage test applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act on a consolidated basis. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Relating to our Business and Structure&#8212;Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.&#8221; As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. 

Codes of Ethics 

We and our Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establish procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#8217;s requirements. You may read and copy the code of ethics at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, each code of ethics is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K, and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Adviser are set out below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our directors who are not &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

Introduction 

As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, our Adviser recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy Policies 

Our Adviser votes proxies relating to any of our portfolio equity securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder 

&#160;

vote to determine its effect on any of the portfolio equity securities we hold. In most cases our Adviser will vote in favor of proposals that our Adviser believes are likely to increase the value of any of the portfolio equity securities we hold. Although our Adviser generally votes against proposals that may have a negative effect on any of our portfolio equity securities, our Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

Our proxy voting decisions are made by our Adviser&#8217;s senior investment team. To ensure that our Adviser&#8217;s vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Adviser requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, our Adviser discloses such conflicts to us, including our independent directors and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 

Proxy Voting Records 

You may obtain information without charge about how our Adviser voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: 2755 Sand Hill Road, Suite 150, Menlo Park, California 94025, Attention: Investor Relations. 

Privacy Principles 

We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as are necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders.

Under the 1940 Act, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office. 

We and our Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 

We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities will be our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such affiliate without the prior approval of our independent directors. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain &#8220;joint&#8221; transactions with certain of our affiliates, which could include concurrent investments in the same company, without prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. We are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to any person 

&#160;

that controls us or who owns more than 25% of our voting securities or certain of that person&#8217;s affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. As a result of these restrictions, we may be prohibited from buying or selling any security (other than any security of which we are the issuer) from or to any company that is advised or managed by TPC, our Adviser or their affiliates without the prior approval of the SEC, which may limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us. 

In the future, we may co-invest with TPC and/or investment funds, accounts and vehicles managed by TPC where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. We generally are only permitted to co-invest with TPC and/or such investment funds, accounts and vehicles where the only term that is negotiated is price. However, we, TPC and our Adviser have filed an exemptive application with the SEC to permit greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments with TPC and/or investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by TPC in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Even though we have filed this exemptive application, there can be no assurance that we will receive exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to co-invest with TPC and/or investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by TPC where terms other than price are negotiated. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#160;

(1) 

pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

&#160;

(2) 

pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 

&#160;

(3) 

pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. When we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to audit our internal controls over financial reporting; and 

&#160;

(4) 

pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated under such act. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we comply with that act. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and we are eligible to take advantage of certain specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We expect to remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) December 31 of the fiscal year that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year 

&#160;

period. In addition, we have irrevocably opted-out of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, we comply with new or revised accounting standards on the same time frames as other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies.&#8221; 

Corporate Governance Regulations 

The NYSE has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with these corporate governance listing standards. We monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and take all necessary actions to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
