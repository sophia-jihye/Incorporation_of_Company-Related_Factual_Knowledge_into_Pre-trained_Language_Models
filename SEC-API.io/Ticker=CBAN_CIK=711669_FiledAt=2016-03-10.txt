COLONY BANKCORP, INC. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Colony Bankcorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Colony&#8221;) is a Georgia business corporation which was incorporated on November 8, 1982. The Company was organized for the purpose of operating as a bank holding company under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the bank holding company laws of Georgia (Georgia Laws 1976, p. 168, et. seq.) . On July 22, 1983, the Company, after obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals, acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of Colony Bank (formerly Colony Bank of Fitzgerald and The Bank of Fitzgerald), Fitzgerald, Georgia, through the merger of the Bank with a subsidiary of the Company which was created for the purpose of organizing the Bank into a one-bank holding company. Since that time, Colony Bank has operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our business is conducted primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, which provides a broad range of banking services to its retail and commercial customers. The company headquarters are located at 115 South Grant Street, Fitzgerald, Georgia 31750, its telephone number is 229-426-6000 and its Internet address is http://www.colonybank.com . We operate twenty-nine domestic banking offices and one corporate operations office and, at December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.17 billion in total assets, $758.64 million in total loans, $1.01 billion in total deposits and $95.46 million in stockholder&#8217;s equity. Deposits are insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

&#160; 

The Parent Company 

&#160; 

Because Colony Bankcorp, Inc. is a bank holding company, its principal operations are conducted through its subsidiary bank, Colony Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). It has 100 percent ownership of its subsidiary and maintains systems of financial, operational and administrative controls that permit centralized evaluation of the operations of the subsidiary bank in selected functional areas including operations, accounting, marketing, investment management, purchasing, human resources, computer services, auditing, compliance and credit review. As a bank holding company, we perform certain stockholder and investor relations functions. 

&#160;

&#160; 

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company formed Colony Bankcorp Statutory Trust III for the sole purpose of issuing $4,500,000 in Trust Preferred Securities through a pool sponsored by FTN Financial Capital Market. The securities have a maturity of thirty years and are redeemable after five years with certain exceptions.

&#160; 

During the third quarter of 2007, the Company formed Colony Bankcorp Capital Trust III for the sole purpose of issuing $5,000,000 in Trust Preferred Securities through a pool sponsored by Trapeza Capital Management, LLC. The securities have a maturity of thirty years and are redeemable after five years with certain exceptions. Proceeds from this issuance were used to pay off trust preferred securities issued on December 19, 2002 through Colony Bankcorp Statutory Trust II. 

&#160; 

Markets and Competition 

&#160; 

The banking industry in general is highly competitive. Our market areas of central, south and coastal Georgia have experienced good economic and population growth the past several years. In contrast to our rural markets, in which we typically rank in the top three in terms of market share, in our larger markets, we face competitive pressures in attracting deposits and making loans from larger regional banks and smaller community banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, consumer finance companies, mortgage bankers, brokerage firms and insurance companies. The principal factors in competing for deposits and loans include interest rates, fee structures, range of products and services offered and convenience of office and ATM locations. The banking industry is also experiencing increased competition for deposits from less traditional sources such as money market and mutual funds. In addition, intense market demands, economic concerns, volatile interest rates and customer awareness of product and services have forced banks to be more competitive - often resulting in margin compression and a decrease in operating efficiency. 

&#160; 

Correspondents 

&#160; 

Colony Bank has correspondent relationships with the following banks: Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, Georgia; SunTrust Bank in Atlanta, Georgia; FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, CenterState Bank in Lake Wales, Florida and Federal Home Loan Bank in Atlanta, Georgia. These correspondent relationships facilitate the transactions of business by means of loans, collections, investment services, lines of credit and exchange services, particularly in markets in which Colony Bank does not have a physical presence. As compensation for these services, the Bank maintains balances with its correspondents in noninterest-bearing accounts and pays some service charges.

Employees 

&#160; 

On December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of 321 employees, 307 of which are full-time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. 

&#160; 

The Company has a profit-sharing plan covering all employees subject to certain minimum age and service requirements. In addition, the Company maintains a comprehensive employee benefit program providing, among other benefits, hospitalization, major medical, life insurance and disability insurance. Management considers these benefits to be competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our market area. Colony&#8217;s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. 

&#160;

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company under federal and state law, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). Our bank subsidiary, Colony Bank, is chartered in the State of Georgia and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance (the &#8220;Georgia Department&#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). In addition, as discussed in more detail below, Colony Bank could be subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). Supervision, regulation, and examination of the company and the Bank by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC, rather than holders of our capital stock. 

&#160; 

This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank&#8217;s business. Any change in laws, regulations, or supervisory actions, whether by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Georgia Department, the CFPB, Congress or the Georgia legislature, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank. 

&#160; 

We are also required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and Nasdaq. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2015 are included in this report under &#8220;Section 9A. Controls and Procedures.&#8221; 

&#160; 

From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Recent Regulatory Developments-- The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes, the imposition of increased capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or are likely to affect our operations or the operations of Colony Bank include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Creation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

New prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity to engage in proprietary trading for its own account and have certain interests in, or relationships with, certain unregistered hedge funds, private equity funds and commodity pools. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Application of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirement that holding companies and their subsidiary banks be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Permanently raising the FDIC&#8217;s standard maximum insurance amount to $250,000. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Repealed the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions that are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk underlying the securities. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

While many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, others will continue to be implemented over time. Given the extent of the changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act and the significant discretion afforded to federal regulators to implement those changes, we cannot fully predict the extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors. 

&#160; 

The following items and information provided in subsequent sections provide a further description of certain relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and their potential impact on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively. 

&#160; 

Creation of New Governmental Authorities. The Dodd-Frank Act created various new governmental authorities such as the CFPB, an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The CFPB&#8217;s authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as us, for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions&#8217; primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a &#8220;sampling basis&#8221; and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also may participate in examinations of Colony Bank, which currently has assets of less than $10 billion, and could supervise and examine other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions. 

&#160; 

Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and Colony Bank, that prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies, but have not yet finalized any rules. Neither we nor Colony Bank has any incentive compensation plans at this time. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Shareholder Say-On-Pay Votes. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders&#39; votes on proposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. The first say-on-pay vote occurred at our 2011 annual shareholders meeting. The say-on-pay, the say-on-parachute and the say-on-frequency votes are explicitly nonbinding and cannot override a decision of our board of directors. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve and other regulators jointly issued final rules implementing requirements of a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; The Volcker Rule generally prohibits us and our subsidiaries from (i) engaging in proprietary trading for our own account, and (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a &#8220;covered fund,&#8221; all subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also specifies certain limited activities in which we and our subsidiaries may continue to engage. The regulators provided for a Volcker Rule conformance date of July 21, 2015. The Federal Reserve extended the conformance deadline to July 21, 2016 for certain legacy &#8220;covered funds&#8221; activities and investments in place before December 31, 2013 , and the Federal Reserve expressed its intention to grant the last available statutory extension for such covered funds activities until July 21, 2017. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company, we are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports and such other information as the Federal Reserve may request. Ongoing supervision is provided through regular examinations by the Federal Reserve and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management&#8217;s ability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve may also examine our non-bank subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Expansion and Activity Limitations . The BHCA permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Georgia or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. Federal law also permits national and state-chartered banks to branch interstate through acquisitions of banks in other states, subject to certain requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, under the BHCA, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of, any company engaged in the following activities: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Banking or managing or controlling banks; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Factoring accounts receivable; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226;

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies that elect and retain &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) may engage in broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval. Pursuant to the GLBA and the Dodd-Frank Act, in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of that bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed, and, except in limited circumstances, depository subsidiaries must be in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. Failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a fixed time period could lead to the required divestiture of subsidiary banks or the termination of all activities that do not conform to those permissible for a bank holding company. The Company has not elected financial holding company status and neither Company nor the Bank has engaged in any activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 

&#160; 

Other Restrictions on the Company&#8217;s Activities 

&#160; 

As contained in both federal and state banking laws and regulations, a wide range of requirements and restrictions apply to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries which: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies to meet or exceed minimum capital requirements; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Limit dividends payable to shareholders and restrict the ability of bank holding companies to obtain dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require the prior approval for changes in senior executive officer or directors and prohibit golden parachute payments, including change in control agreements, or new employment agreements with such payment terms, which are contingent upon termination when a bank holding company is deemed to be in troubled condition; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem securities in certain situations; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require prior approval of acquisitions and mergers with other banks or bank holding companies and consider certain competitive, management, financial, and compliance concerns. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Source of Strength 

&#160; 

Federal Reserve policy requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength and to support its bank subsidiary in situations where additional investments in a troubled bank may not otherwise be warranted. The holding company could be required to guarantee the capital plan of the Bank if it becomes undercapitalized for purposes of banking regulations. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. The BHCA provides that, in the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act has codified the Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s new provisions authorize the Federal Reserve to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its &#8220;source of strength&#8221; obligations and to enforce the company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. 

&#160; 

Change in Control 

&#160; 

As a general proposition, other companies seeking to acquire control of a bank holding company would require the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. In addition, individuals or groups of individuals seeking to acquire control of a bank holding company would need to file a prior notice with the Federal Reserve (which the Federal Reserve may disapprove under certain circumstances) under the Change in Bank Control Act. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Control may exist under the Change in Bank Control Act if the individual or company acquires 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

&#160; 

We and Colony Bank were required to comply with higher minimum capital requirements as of January 1, 2015. These new rules (&#8220;Revised Capital Rules&#8221;) implement the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate international regulatory regime known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; (which is discussed below). Prior to January 1, 2015, we and Colony Bank were subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC for bank holding companies and state non-member banks, respectively. The risk-based capital guidelines that applied to us and Colony Bank through December 31, 2014 were based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the U.S. federal banking agencies on an interagency basis. 

&#160; 

The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of the Revised Capital Rules and their impact on our capital levels. Among other things, the Revised Capital Rules (i) introduced a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) specified that Tier 1 Capital consist of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 Capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain requirements, (iii) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulation that apply to us and other banking organizations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

New Minimum Capital Requirements. The Revised Capital Rules required the following initial minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets 

&#160; &#9679; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#160; &#9679; 

8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#160; &#9679; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the "leverage ratio") 

&#160; 

Capital Conservation Buffer. The Revised Capital Rules also introduced a new &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of this difference. 

&#160; 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Revised Capital Rules will require us and Colony Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7% (4.5% attributable to CET1 plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5% (6.0% attributable to Tier 1 capital plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5% (8.0% attributable to Total capital plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority&#39;s risk-adjusted measure for market risk). 

&#160; 

Regulatory Deductions. The Revised Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1, including the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a three-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter until fully phased-in at January 1, 2018). 

&#160; 

Under the Revised Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items (except gains and losses on cash flow hedges where the hedged item is not recognized on a banking organization&#8217;s balance sheet at fair value) are not excluded; however, certain banking organizations, including us and Colony Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. We and Colony Bank each made this election as of January 1, 2015. The Revised Capital Rules also preclude counting certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank or thrift holding companies. However, for bank or thrift holding companies that had assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009 like us, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Tier 1 capital to the extent that they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital after applying all capital deductions and adjustments. 

&#160; 

Management believes, at December 31, 2015, that we and Colony Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Revised Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.

&#160; 

Dividends 

&#160; 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The principal source of the Company&#8217;s cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its stockholders, is dividends that the Bank pays to it. A variety of federal and state laws and regulations affect the ability of the Bank and the Company to pay dividends. For example, Georgia law requires prior approval for a bank to pay dividends where the aggregate amount of dividends to be declared or anticipated to be declared during the current calendar year exceeds 50 percent of its net after-tax profits before dividends for the previous calendar year. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies may prevent the payment of a dividend if they determine that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company&#8217;s dividends if: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

It will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 

&#160; 

Neither the Company nor Colony Bank can give assurances that it will receive all required regulatory approvals to pay dividends. Subject to these regulatory restrictions, future cash dividends by the Company and the Bank will depend upon management&#8217;s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 

&#160; 

Colony Bank received regulatory approvals in 2014 to pay a dividend of $12 million to the Company, the proceeds of which were used in 2014 to pay Preferred Stock dividends and interest due on the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures. The Bank was also granted approval to pay total dividend payments of $10 million to the Company during 2015, and the Company used these proceeds to redeem $9,979 million of Preferred Stock during 2015.

BANK REGULATION 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Georgia, and as such is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Georgia Department. The Bank is a member of the FDIC, and their deposits are insured by the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund up to the amount permitted by law. The FDIC and the Georgia Department routinely examine the Bank and monitor and regulate all of the Bank&#8217;s operations, including such things as adequacy of reserves, quality and documentation of loans, payments of dividends, capital adequacy, adequacy of systems and controls, credit underwriting and asset liability management, compliance with laws and establishment of branches. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank is subject to state usury laws and certain federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank files periodic reports with the FDIC and the Georgia Department. 

&#160; 

FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;, &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221;, and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;. A depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. 

&#160; 

All of the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels for federally insured depository institutions. Notably, the Revised Capital Rule updated the prompt corrective action framework to correspond to the rule&#8217;s new minimum capital thresholds, which took effect on January 1, 2015. Under this new framework, (i) a well-capitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, a leverage capital ratio of 5 percent or greater and that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) an adequately-capitalized depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of 8 percent or more, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent or more, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent or more, and a leverage ratio of 4 percent or more; (iii) an undercapitalized depository institution is one having a total capital ratio of less than 8 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or a leverage ratio of less than 4 percent; and (iv) a significantly undercapitalized institution is one having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4 percent, a CET1 ratio of less than 3 percent or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3 percent. The Revised Capital Rules retain the 2 percent threshold for critically undercapitalized institutions, but make certain changes to the framework for calculating an institution&#8217;s ratio of tangible equity to total assets. 

&#160;

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Colony Bank was considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; and the consolidated capital ratios of the Company were as follows:

Represents the minimum requirement. Institutions that are contemplating acquisitions or anticipating or experiencing significant growth may be required to maintain a substantially higher leverage ratio. 

&#160; 

The federal banking agencies may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed to be well capitalized and may therefore be subject to applicable restrictions. 

&#160; 

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval within 90 days of becoming undercapitalized. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. If the controlling holding company fails to fulfill its obligations under FDICIA and files (or has filed against it) a petition under the federal Bankruptcy Code, the claim for such liability would be entitled to a priority in such bankruptcy proceeding over third party creditors of the bank holding company. In addition, an undercapitalized institution is subject to increased monitoring and asset growth restrictions and is required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions, new lines of business, and branching. Such an institution also is barred from soliciting, taking or rolling over brokered deposits. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming significantly undercapitalized, except under limited circumstances. Because our company and Colony Bank exceed applicable capital requirements, the respective managements of our company and Colony Bank do not believe that the provisions of FDICIA have had any material effect on our company and Colony Bank or our respective operations. 

&#160; 

FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of our company and Colony Bank, including reporting requirements, regulatory standards for real estate lending, &#8220;truth in savings&#8221; provisions, the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days&#8217; prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch, and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized, or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the FDIC. Colony Bank was well capitalized at December 31, 2015, and brokered deposits are not restricted. 

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. 

&#160; 

The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

The federal and Georgia regulatory structures give the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. If, as a result of an examination, the Georgia Department or the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the Georgia Department and the FDIC , and separately the FDIC as insurer of the Bank&#8217;s deposits, have residual authority to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which may preclude the Bank from being deemed well capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Restrict the Bank&#8217;s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions, including bidding in FDIC receiverships for failed banks; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions, including required Board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes; remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the charter and/or take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank or appoint the FDIC as receiver. 

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

&#160; 

Colony Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC&#8217;s DIF, and Colony Bank is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance, as well as assessments by the FDIC to pay interest on Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) bonds. 

&#160; 

Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC began calculating assessments based on an institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity in accordance with changes mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC also established a new assessment rate schedule, as well as alternative rate schedules that become effective when the DIF reserve ratio reaches certain levels. In determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by insured depository institutions, the FDIC generally assigns institutions to one of four risk categories based on supervisory ratings and capital ratios. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Under proposed rules set forth by the FDIC in October 2015, banks with at least $10 billion in assets would pay a surcharge to enable the reserve ratio to reach 1.35 percent . In addition, the FDIC collects FICO deposit assessments, which are calculated off of the assessment base described above. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s FDIC insurance expense totaled $899 thousand for 2015. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering . The International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Funding Act of 2001 specifies &#8220;know your customer&#8221; requirements that obligate financial institutions to take actions to verify the identity of the account holders in connection with opening an account at any U.S. financial institution. Banking regulators will consider compliance with the Act&#8217;s money laundering provisions in acting upon acquisition and merger proposals. Sanctions for violations of the Act can be imposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to $1 million. 

&#160;

Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (&#8220;USA PATRIOT&#8221;) Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. 

&#160; 

The USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs with minimum standards that include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The designation of a compliance officer; 

&#160; &#9679; 

An ongoing employee training program; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

An independent audit function to test the programs. 

&#160; 

Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has proposed new regulations that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information for certain accounts, however, it has yet to establish final regulations on this topic. 

&#160; 

Economic Sanctions . The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Transactions with Related Parties . We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Colony Bank and our other subsidiaries. Various legal limitations restrict our banking subsidiary from lending or otherwise supplying funds to us or our non-bank subsidiaries. We and our banking subsidiary are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the corresponding provisions of Federal Reserve Regulation W thereunder. Section 23A defines &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; to include, among other types of transactions, extensions of credit, and limits a bank&#8217;s covered transactions with any of its &#8220;affiliates&#8221; to 10% of such bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. All covered and exempt transactions between a bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and banks and their operating subsidiaries are prohibited from purchasing low-quality assets from the bank&#8217;s affiliates. Finally, Section 23A requires that all of a bank&#8217;s extensions of credit to its affiliates be appropriately secured by acceptable collateral, generally United States government or agency securities. 

&#160; 

We and our bank subsidiary also are subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the corresponding provisions of Federal Reserve Regulation W thereunder, which generally require covered transactions and certain other transactions between a bank and its affiliates to be on terms, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to, the bank as those prevailing at the time for similar transactions with unaffiliated companies. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on banks&#8217; transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Specifically, Section 608 of the Dodd-Frank Act broadens the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The revised definition also includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to a third party. Furthermore, reverse repurchase transactions will be viewed as extensions of credit (instead of asset purchases) and thus become subject to collateral requirements. These expanded definitions took effect on July 21, 2012. The ability of the Federal Reserve to grant exemptions from these restrictions is also narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act, including with respect to the requirement for the OCC, FDIC and Federal Reserve to coordinate with one another. 

&#160; 

Concentrations in Lending . During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on &#8220;Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending&#8221; (the &#8220;Guidance&#8221;) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100 percent or more of a bank&#8217;s total risk based capital; or 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300 percent or more of a bank&#8217;s total risk based capital. 

&#160; 

The Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. We and our banking subsidiary are subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) and related federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; regulations. Under the CRA, all banks and thrifts have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs for their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA requires a depository institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator, in connection with its examination of the institution, to assess the institution&#8217;s record of assessing and meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that institution, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The bank regulatory agency&#8217;s assessment of the institution&#8217;s record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any institution which has applied to: (i) charter a national bank; (ii) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly-chartered institution; (iii) establish a new branch office that accepts deposits; (iv) relocate an office; (v) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution, or (vi) expand other activities, including engaging in financial services activities authorized by the GLBA. A less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company. 

&#160; 

Following the enactment of the GLBA, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to a bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become or remain a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under GLBA may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating in its latest CRA examination. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. 

&#160; 

Privacy and Data Security. The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLBA. The GLBA also directed federal regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. Colony Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach. Under federal law, Colony Bank must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit customers to opt out of having nonpublic customer information disclosed to third parties in certain circumstances, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. We are similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused. 

&#160; 

Consumer Regulation. &#160; The Bank must comply with numerous federal and state anti-money laundering and consumer protection and privacy statutes and implementing regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001, GLBA, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (effective 2013), the CRA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, and various federal and state privacy protection laws. Noncompliance with these laws could subject the Bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, fines and reimbursements. The Bank and the Company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Activities of Colony Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, servicing, collecting, and foreclosure of loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

&#160; 

These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679;

Mortgage-Related Reforms. The CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;ATR/QM rule&#8221;), which took effect on January 10, 2014, and has impacted our residential mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market generally. The ATR/QM rule requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; for lenders that issue certain &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; The ATR/QM rule defines a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 percent. While &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; that are &#8220;higher priced mortgages&#8221; (which are generally subprime loans). In particular, it will prevent banks from making &#8220;no doc&#8221; and &#8220;low doc&#8221; home loans, as the rules require that banks determine a consumer&#8217;s ability to pay based in part on verified and documented information. Because we do not originate &#8220;no doc&#8221; or &#8220;low doc&#8221; loans, we do not believe this regulation will have a significant effect on our operations.

&#160; 

In addition, under rules that became effective December 24, 2015, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as &#8220;qualified residential mortgages.&#8221; These definitions are expected to significantly shape the parameters for the majority of consumer mortgage lending in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Reflecting the CFPB&#39;s focus on the residential mortgage lending market, the CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) and has finalized integrated mortgage disclosure rules that replace and combine certain requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In addition, t he CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower &#8217;s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers &#8217; applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts. The CFPB has indicated that it expects to issue additional mortgage-related rules in the future. 

&#160; 

It is anticipated that the CFPB will engage in numerous other rulemakings in the near term that may impact our business, as the CFPB has indicated that, in addition to specific statutory mandates, it is working on a wide range of initiatives to address issues in markets for consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has also undertaken an effort to &#8220;streamline&#8221; consumer regulations and has established a database to collect, track and make public consumer complaints, including complaints against individual financial institutions. 

&#160; 

The CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;) and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate this prohibition, certain aspects of these standards are untested, which has created some uncertainty regarding how the CFPB will exercise this authority. The CFPB has, however, begun to bring enforcement actions against certain financial institutions for UDAAP violations and issued some guidance on the topic, which provides insight into the agency&#8217;s expectations regarding these standards. Among other things, CFPB guidance and its UDAAP-related enforcement actions have emphasized that management of third-party service providers is essential to effective UDAAP compliance and that the CFPB is particularly focused on marketing and sales practices.

Part I (Continued) 

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Significant recent CFPB developments that may affect the Bank&#8217;s operations and compliance costs include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The issuance of final rules for residential mortgage lending, which became effective January 10, 2014, including definitions for &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; and detailed standards by which lenders must satisfy themselves of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan and revised forms of disclosure under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The issuance of a policy report on arbitration clauses which could result in the restriction or prohibition of lenders including arbitration clauses in consumer financial services contracts; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Actions taken to regulate and supervise credit bureaus and debt collections; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Positions taken by the CFPB on fair lending, including applying the disparate impact theory in auto financing, which could make it harder for lenders to charge different rates or apply different terms to loans to different customers. 

&#160; 

We cannot fully predict the effect that being regulated by a new, additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection, or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority, will have on our businesses. 

&#160; 

The deposit operations of Colony Bank are also subject to laws and regulations that: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require Colony Bank to adequately disclose the interest rates and other terms of consumer deposit accounts; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Impose a duty on Colony Bank to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribe procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require escheatment of unclaimed funds to the appropriate state agencies after the passage of certain statutory time frames; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts with Colony Bank and the rights and liabilities of customers who use automated teller machines, or ATMs, and other electronic banking services. Beginning in July 2010, new rules took effect that limited Colony Bank&#8217;s ability to charge fees for the payment of overdrafts for every day debit and ATM card transactions. 

&#160; 

Non-Discrimination Policies. Colony Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the &#8220;ECOA&#8221;) and the Fair Housing Act (the &#8220;FHA&#8221;), both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;), and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA.

Item 1 (Continued) 

&#160; 

Enforcement Authority . Colony Bank and its &#8220;institution-affiliated parties,&#8221; including management, employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution&#8217;s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. Violations can include failure to timely file required reports, filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations, and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for 20 years. Regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties, and the FDIC has the authority to terminate deposit insurance. When issued by a banking agency, cease-and-desist orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency. The federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution (or bar them from the industry) if a violation is willful or reckless. 

&#160; 

Evolving Legislation and Regulatory Action . Proposals for new statutes and regulations are frequently circulated at both the federal and state levels, and may include wide-ranging changes to the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Matters . We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), Nasdaq and various state securities regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. 

&#160; 

Iran Sanctions Related Disclosure 

&#160; 

Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are required to include certain disclosures in our periodic reports if we or any of our &#8220;affiliates&#8221; knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because the SEC defines the term &#8220;affiliate&#8221; broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us. We do not believe we and our consolidated subsidiaries have knowingly engaged in any transaction or dealing reportable under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act during fiscal year 2015.
