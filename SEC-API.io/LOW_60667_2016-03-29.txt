Customers, Market and Competition 

Our Customers 

We serve homeowners, renters, and professional customers (Pro customers). Retail customers, comprised of individual homeowners and renters, complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer consists of two broad categories: construction trades; and maintenance, repair &#38; operations. 

Our Market 

&#160; 

We are among the many businesses, including home centers, paint stores, hardware stores, lumber yards and garden centers, whose revenues are included in the Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers Subsector (444) of the Retail Trade Sector of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2015 was $332.1 billion, which represented an increase of 4.2% over the amount reported for the same category in 2014. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2014 was $318.7 billion, which represented an increase of 5.5% over the amount reported for the same category in 2013. These figures are subject to periodic revision by the U.S. Department of Commerce. 

NAICS 444 represents less than half of what we consider the total market for our products and services. The broader market in which Lowe&#8217;s operates includes home-related sales through a variety of companies beyond those in NAICS 444. These consist of other companies in the retail sector, including mass retailers, home furnishings stores, and online retailers, as well as wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, businesses, and the government. Based on our analysis of the most recent comprehensive data available, we estimate the size of the U.S. home improvement market at $735 billion in 2015, comprised of $548 billion of product sales and $187 billion of installed labor sales. That compares with $688 billion total market sales in 2014, comprised of $511 billion of product sales and $177 billion of installed labor sales. These figures are subject to periodic revision by the U.S. Department of Commerce and other third-party sources. 

&#160; 

There are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowe&#8217;s offers. Key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income, employment, home prices, and housing turnover. We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Growth in real disposable personal income is projected to moderate to 2.9% in 2016 as compared with 3.4% growth in 2015, based on the March 2016 Blue Chip Economic Indicators &#174; . * 

*Blue Chip Economic Indicators &#174; (ISSN: 0193-4600) is published monthly by Aspen Publishers, 76 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10011, a division of Wolters Kluwer Law and Business. Printed in the U.S.A. 

&#8226; 

The average unemployment rate for 2016 is forecasted to decline to 4.7%, according to the March 2016 Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which would be an improvement from the 5.3% average in 2015. The unemployment rate should continue to trend lower as the job market continues to expand at a moderate pace. 

&#8226; 

Recent evidence suggests that home prices will continue to increase. In 2015, home price appreciation increased 5.5% which was consistent with the 2014 increase, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency index. Economists generally expect the rate of home price growth to moderate to 3.2% in 2016. 

&#8226; 

Housing turnover increased an estimated 7.4% in 2015 after a 2.6% decrease in 2014, according to The National Association of Realtors and U.S. Census Bureau. Turnover is generally expected to continue to increase in 2016, supported by a strengthening jobs market, rising incomes, and historically low mortgage rates. 

These indicators are important to our business because they signal a customer&#8217;s willingness to engage in home maintenance, repair, and upgrade projects and favorably impact income available to purchase our products and services. Overall, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive for 2016. The lagged benefit of stronger home buying and continued home price appreciation should drive home improvement spending in 2016, offsetting moderation in job growth and the ongoing potential pressure on mortgage rates. 

Our Competition 

The home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape. We compete with other home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas. We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers. In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, warehouse clubs, and online and other specialty retailers as well as service providers that install home improvement products. Location of stores continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry; however, the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underscore the importance of omni-channel capabilities as a competitive factor. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing better customer experiences while delivering superior value in products and service. See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

Our Products 

Product Selection 

To meet customers&#8217; varying home improvement needs, we offer a complete line of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating. We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Lumber &#38; Building Materials; Tools &#38; Hardware; Appliances; Fashion Fixtures; Rough Plumbing &#38; Electrical; Lawn &#38; Garden; Seasonal Living; Paint; Flooring; Millwork; Kitchens; Outdoor Power Equipment, and Home Fashions. A typical Lowe&#8217;s home improvement store stocks approximately 36,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of additional items available through our Special Order Sales system, Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, and ATGstores.com. See Note 15 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years. 

We are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of private brands. In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost effective manner. 

National Brand-Name Merchandise 

In many product categories, customers look for a familiar and trusted national brand to instill confidence in their purchase. Lowe&#8217;s home improvement stores carry a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise such as Whirlpool &#174; &#32;appliances and water heaters, GE &#174; , LG &#174; , and Samsung &#174; &#32;appliances, Stainmaster &#174; &#32;carpets, Valspar &#174; &#32;paints and stains, Pella &#174; &#32;windows and doors, Sylvania &#174; &#32;light bulbs, Dewalt &#174; &#32;power tools, Owens Corning &#174; &#32;roofing, Johns Manville &#174; &#32;insulation, James Hardie &#174; &#32;fiber cement siding, Husqvarna &#174; &#32;outdoor power equipment, Werner &#174; &#32;ladders, and many more. In 2015, we added brand name merchandise such as HGTV HOME &#174; &#32;by Sherwin-Williams &#174; &#32;paints, Kichler &#174; lighting, Owens Corning &#174; &#32;insulation, GAF &#174; &#32;roofing, and Diamond &#174; &#32;vanities to our portfolio. Our merchandise selection provides the retail and Pro customer a one-stop shop for a wide variety of national brand-name merchandise needed to complete home improvement, repair, maintenance, or construction projects. 

Private Brands 

Private brands are an important element of our overall portfolio, helping to provide significant value and coordinated style across core categories. We sell private brands in several of our product categories. Some of Lowe&#8217;s most important private brands include Kobalt &#174; &#32;tools, allen+roth &#174; &#32;home d&#233;cor products, Blue Hawk &#174; &#32;home improvement products, Project Source &#174; &#32;basic value products, Portfolio &#174; &#32;lighting products, Garden Treasures &#174; &#32;lawn and patio products, Utilitech &#174; &#32;electrical and utility products, Reliabilt &#174; &#32;doors and windows, Aquasource &#174; &#32;faucets, sinks and toilets, Harbor Breeze &#174; &#32;ceiling fans, Top Choice &#174; &#32;lumber products and Iris &#174; &#32;home automation and management products. 

Supply Chain 

We source our products from over 7,500 vendors worldwide with no single vendor accounting for more than 6% of total purchases. We believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin. 

To efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers. These facilities include 15 highly-automated Regional Distribution Centers (RDC) in the United States. On average, each domestic RDC serves approximately 115 stores. We also own and operate a distribution facility to serve our Canadian stores and lease and operate a distribution facility to serve our Orchard stores. Additionally, we have a service agreement with a third party logistics provider to manage a distribution facility to serve our stores in Mexico. 

In addition to the RDCs, we also operate coastal holding facilities, transload facilities, appliance distribution centers, and flatbed distribution centers. The flatbed distribution centers distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. Collectively, our facilities enable our import and e-commerce, as well as parcel post eligible products, to get to their destination as efficiently as possible. Most parcel post items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates. 

In fiscal 2015 , on average, approximately 80% of the total dollar amount of stock merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores from vendors. 

Our Services 

Installed Sales 

We offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Appliances, Flooring, Kitchens, Lumber &#38; Building Materials, and Millwork accounting for the majority of installed sales. Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 8% of total sales in fiscal 2015 . 

Extended Protection Plans and Repair Services 

We offer extended protection plans in Kitchens, Appliances, Tools &#38; Hardware, Outdoor Power Equipment, Seasonal Living, and Rough Plumbing. Lowe&#8217;s protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage previously offered by the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty. Our extended protection plans provide in-warranty and out-of-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, water heaters, and other eligible products through our stores or in the home through our Lowe&#8217;s Authorized Service Repair Network. We offer replacement plans for products in most of these categories when priced below $200, or otherwise specified category specific price points. Our contact center takes customers&#8217; calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates resolutions, making after-sales service easier for our customers because we manage the entire process. 

Selling Channels 

We are continuing our progress towards becoming an omni-channel retail company, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, approximately 60% are picked up in-store, 10% are delivered from a store, and 30% are parcel shipped. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we continue to introduce. 

In-Store 

Our 1,777 &#32;home improvement stores are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space. In addition, we operate 80 &#32;Orchard hardware stores located throughout California and Oregon that also serve home improvement customers and average approximately 37,000 square feet of retail selling space. Our home improvement stores offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on local market factors; however, Orchard stores are primarily focused on paint, repair, and backyard products. We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes. Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience. 

Online 

Through Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, ATGstores.com and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, online product information, customer ratings and reviews, online buying guides and how-to videos and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. In 2015, sales through our online selling channels accounted for approximately 3% of our total sales. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store as well as delivery or parcel shipment to their homes. 

In addition, during 2015 we re-launched the LowesForPros.com online tool. This full omni-channel experience allows for easy online ordering for our Pro customers, and their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving them time and money. 

On-Site 

We have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects. Our Account Executives ProServices meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage stores within the area to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources. Our Project Specialist Exteriors (PSE) program is available in all Lowe&#8217;s stores to discuss exterior projects such as roofing, siding, fencing, and windows, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach. In addition, our Project Specialist Interiors (PSI) program is available in 11 of our 14 regions to provide similar consultative services on interior projects such as kitchens and bathrooms. 

Contact Centers 

Lowe&#8217;s operates three contact centers which are located in Wilkesboro, NC, Albuquerque, NM, and Indianapolis, IN. These contact centers help Lowe&#8217;s enable an omni-channel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, facilitate repair services for Appliances and Outdoor Power Equipment, and answer general customer questions via phone, e-mail, letters, and social media. 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of January 29, 2016 , we employed approximately 180,000 full-time and 90,000 part-time employees. Our employees in Mexico are subject to collective bargaining agreements. No other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its relations with employees to be good. 

Seasonality and Working Capital 

The retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal. Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December and January). Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes. We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed. For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Intellectual Property 

The name &#8220;Lowe&#8217;s&#8221; is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary has various additional trademarks, trade names and service marks, many of which are used in our private brand program. The subsidiary also maintains various Internet 

domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations. 

Environmental Stewardship 

Lowe&#8217;s recognizes how efficient operations can help protect the environment and our bottom line. We examine our operations regularly to deliver energy efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize waste generation through increased recycling. &#32; We also invest in technology that will help us operate our facilities more efficiently and environmentally responsibly. 

We annually track our carbon footprint and participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project, an independent nonprofit organization hosting the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world. To further reduce our carbon footprint, we incorporate energy-efficient technologies and architectural systems into new stores and retrofits of existing stores, such as energy-efficient lighting, white membrane cool roofs, and HVAC units that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR qualifications. We also participate in demand response programs by voluntarily reducing our lighting and HVAC loads during peak demand periods to support electric grid reliability. 

During 2015, we began testing a state-of-the-art building management system in stores to control lighting, air conditioning and other building systems. We also implemented a light-emitting diode (LED) lighting initiative in select markets and new stores. All light sources for new stores constructed in the future will be LED. 

We strive to deliver products to our stores in a fuel-efficient and an environmentally responsible manner through participation in the SmartWay&#174; Transport Partnership, an innovative program launched by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2004 that promotes cleaner, more fuel-efficient transportation options. Lowe&#8217;s received a 2015 SmartWay Excellence Award from the EPA, our seventh consecutive SmartWay honor, for our commitment to environmental excellence in freight management operations and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and other harmful pollutants. We have also increased shipping of products by rail and increased the efficiency of truckload shipments to and from our RDCs. 

We continue to take steps to improve our recycling programs and reduce the amount of waste we generate. Through these efforts, we are able to reduce our disposal costs and minimize the impact on the environment of the operation of our stores and other facilities. We also offer convenient recycling for our customers at many of our stores for items such as rechargeable batteries, plastic bags and compact fluorescent light bulbs. 

Additionally, we continue to focus on helping consumers reduce their energy and water use and their environmental footprint while saving money when they purchase our products and services. We offer a wide selection of environmentally responsible and energy-efficient products for the home, including ENERGY STAR &#174; &#32;appliances, WaterSense &#174; &#32;labeled toilets, paint with no volatile organic compounds (VOC), and indoor and outdoor LED lighting. Through our in-home sales specialists, we offer customers installation of insulation and energy efficient windows.

Compliance with Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways, including indirectly through increased energy costs, as utilities, refineries, and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to additional regulation or legislation that seeks to better control greenhouse gas emissions. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 &#32;for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations. 

&#160; 

Investing in Our Communities 

Lowe&#8217;s has a long and proud history of supporting local communities through public education and community improvement projects, beginning with the creation of the Lowe&#8217;s Charitable and Educational Foundation in 1957. In 2015, Lowe&#8217;s and the Lowe&#8217;s Charitable and Educational Foundation donated more than $33 million to schools and community organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 

Our commitment to improving educational opportunities is best exemplified by our signature education grant program, Lowe&#8217;s Toolbox for Education &#174; , and 2015 marked the program&#8217;s 10-year anniversary. Since its inception, Lowe&#8217;s Toolbox for 

Education has provided approximately $48 million in grants, funding improvements at nearly 11,000 schools and benefiting more than six million children along the way. 

Each year, we work with national nonprofit partners to strengthen and stabilize neighborhoods in the communities we serve. In 2015, Lowe&#8217;s contributed $7 million and teamed with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together to provide housing solutions in partnership with families across the country. We also continued to build on our longstanding partnerships with the Boys &#38; Girls Clubs of America, SkillsUSA, The Nature Conservancy, and Keep America Beautiful to improve communities and build tomorrow&#8217;s leaders. &#160; 

Lowe&#8217;s is also committed to helping residents of the communities we serve by being there when we&#8217;re needed most - when a natural disaster threatens and in the recovery that follows. In 2015, Lowe&#8217;s donated nearly $1.5 million and mobilized hundreds of Lowe&#8217;s Heroes employee volunteers to help families recover from disasters across the United States. 

Altogether, Lowe&#8217;s completed 3,795 community improvement projects in 2015. And for the first time, every single Lowe&#8217;s store in the United States participated in a Lowe&#8217;s Heroes volunteer project.
