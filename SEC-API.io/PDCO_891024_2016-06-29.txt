 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Certain information of a non-historical nature contained in Items 1, 2, 3 and 7 of this Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements. Reference is made to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7, for a discussion of certain factors that could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. 

General 

Patterson Companies, Inc. is a value-added specialty distributor serving the U.S. and Canadian dental supply and the U.S., Canadian and U.K. animal health supply markets. Patterson operates through its two strategic business units, Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health, offering similar products and services to different customer bases. Each business is a market leader with a strong competitive position, serves a fragmented market that offers consolidation opportunities and offers relatively low-cost consumable supplies, making our value-added business proposition highly attractive to customers. We believe that we have a strong brand identity as a value-added, full-service distributor with broad product and service offerings, having begun distributing dental supplies in 1877. 

Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for Patterson. In June 2015, we more than doubled the size of our animal health supply business through the acquisition of Animal Health International, Inc., for $1.1 billion in cash. This acquisition added a leading production animal supply business to our pre-existing companion animal supply business, resulting in the renaming of our veterinary supply segment to our animal health supply segment. In August 2015, we completed the disposition of our rehabilitative and assistive products supply business, Patterson Medical, for $717 million in cash; the results of this business are now presented as discontinued operations. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about these transactions. 

The following table sets forth consolidated net sales (in millions) by segment. Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the revised current period presentation in which we present three reportable segments: Dental, Animal Health and Corporate.

Our strategically located fulfillment centers enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers&#8217; needs. Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment. 

Patterson became publicly traded in October 1992 and is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota. We are headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. Our principal executive offices are located at 1031 Mendota Heights Road, St. Paul, Minnesota, and our telephone number is (651) 686-1600. Unless the context specifically requires otherwise, the terms the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Patterson,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; mean Patterson Companies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

The Specialty Distribution Markets We Serve 

We provide manufacturers with cost effective logistics and high-caliber sales professionals to access a geographically diverse customer base, which is critical to the supply chain for both of the markets we serve. We provide our customers with a vast array of value-added services, a dedicated and highly skilled sales team, and a broad selection of products through a single 

channel, thereby helping them efficiently manage their ordering process. Due in part to the inability of office-based customers to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of supplies and small equipment to office-based customers has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier. 

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue as distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seek to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base. 

Dental Supply Market 

We estimate the dental supply market we serve to be approximately $7.5 billion annually and our share of this market, when direct distribution by manufacturers is included, to be approximately 33%. This market consists of a sizeable geographically dispersed number of fragmented dental practices. Customers range in size from sole practitioners to large group practices or service organizations. According to the American Dental Association and the Canadian Dental Association, there are over 195,000 dentists practicing in the U.S. and 19,000 dentists practicing in Canada, respectively. We believe the average dental practitioner purchases about 40% of their supplies from their top supplier. 

Total expenditures for dental services in the U.S. increased from $105 billion in 2010 to $114 billion in 2014. We believe the dental supply market continues to experience growth due to U.S. population growth, the aging population, advances in dentistry, demand for preventive dentistry and specialty services, the need for increased office productivity, demand for infection control products, and coverage by dental plans. Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using dental services. In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases. There is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates. At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage. 

We support dental professionals through the many stock keeping units (&#8220;SKUs&#8221;) that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner&#8217;s efficiency. 

Animal Health Supply Market 

We estimate the animal health supply market we serve to be approximately $14 billion annually and our share of this market, when direct distribution by manufacturers is included, to be approximately 23%. Similar to the dental supply market, the animal health supply market is fragmented and diverse. The animal health market is a mix of the production animal market, which primarily consists of beef and dairy cattle, poultry and swine, and other food-producing animals, and the companion animal market, which primarily consists of dogs, cats and horses. Our production animal supply customers include large animal veterinarians, beef producers (cow/calf, stocker and feedlots), dairy producers, poultry producers, swine producers and retail customers. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, there are more than 66,000 veterinarians in private practice in the U.S. and Canada. Furthermore, there are approximately 20,000 veterinarians in the U.K. practicing in veterinary outlets; however, we believe there has been a shift in the U.K. market toward consolidation of veterinary practices. National Veterinary Services Limited, our veterinary products distributor in the U.K., has the highest percentage of buying groups and corporations as customers compared to its competitors. The average purchase of consumables in the animal health market is noticeably higher than that of the dental practitioner due predominantly to pharmaceutical products. 

The animal health market, impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care, as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production, provides growth opportunities for us. We support our animal health customers through the distribution of biologicals, pharmaceuticals, parasiticides, supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development, sale and distribution of inventory, accounting and health management systems. Within the companion animal market, we anticipate increasing demand for veterinary services due to the following factors: the increasing number of households with companion animals, increased expenditures on animal health and preventative care, an aging pet population, advancements in animal health products and diagnostic testing, and extensive marketing programs sponsored by companion animal nutrition and pharmaceutical companies. 

Product sales in the production animal market are impacted by volatility in commodity prices such as milk, grains, livestock and poultry. Changes in weather patterns also influence how long cattle will graze and consequently the number of days 

an animal is on feed during a finishing phase. In addition, changes in the general economy can shift the number of animals treated, the timing of when animals are treated, to what extent they are treated and with which products they are treated. Historically, sales in this market have been largely driven by spending on animal health products to improve productivity, weight gain and disease prevention, as well as a growing focus on food safety. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive. It consists principally of national, regional and local full-service distributors, mail-order distributors and, increasingly, Internet-based businesses. Most of the products we sell are available to customers from a number of suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products. Some manufacturers also sell directly to end-users, thereby eliminating or reducing our role and that of other distributors. 

We compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental and animal health products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services. To differentiate ourselves from our competition we deploy a strategy of premium customer service with multiple value-added components, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, highly-trained and experienced service technicians, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, technology solutions allowing customers to easily access our inventory, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and fulfillment centers, and competitive pricing. 

In the U.S. and Canadian dental supply market, we compete against Henry Schein, Inc., Benco Dental Supply Company, at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level, and hundreds of small local distributors. Also, as noted above, some manufacturers sell directly to end users. With regard to our dental practice management software, we compete against numerous companies, including Carestream Health, Inc. and Henry Schein, Inc. 

In the U.S. and Canadian animal health supply market, our primary competitors are AmerisourceBergen and Henry Schein, Inc. We also compete against a number of regional and local animal health distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers, including pharmaceutical companies that sell directly to production animal operators, animal health product retailers and veterinarians. To a lesser extent, we also compete with mail order distributors and buying groups. We face significant competition in the animal health supply market in the U.K., where we compete on the basis of price and customer service with several large competitors, including Henry Schein, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen. We also compete directly with pharmaceutical companies who sell certain products or services directly to the customer. In the animal health practice management market, our primary competitors are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and Henry Schein, Inc. 

Successful distributors are increasingly providing value-added services in addition to the products they have traditionally provided. We believe that to remain competitive we must continue to add value to the distribution channel, while removing unnecessary costs associated with product movement. Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results. 

Competitive Strengths 

We have more than 130 years of experience in distributing products resulting in strong awareness of the Patterson brand. Although further information regarding these competitive strengths is set forth below in the discussion of our two strategic business units, our competitive strengths include: 

&#8226; 

Broad product and service offerings at competitive prices . We offer over 190,000 SKUs to our customers, including many proprietary branded products. We believe that our proprietary branded products and our competitive pricing strategy have generated a loyal customer base that is confident in our brands. Of the SKUs offered, approximately 90,000 are offered to our dental customers and approximately 100,000 are offered to our animal health customers. Our product offerings include consumables, equipment and software. Our service offerings include software and design services, repair and maintenance, and equipment financing. 

&#8226; 

Focus on customer relationships and exceptional customer service. &#32;Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives, interaction via phone with sales representatives, web-based activities including e-commerce and frequent direct marketing, emphasizing our broad product lines, including exclusive distribution agreements, competitive prices and ease of order placement. We focus on providing our customers with exceptional order fulfillment and a streamlined ordering process. 

&#8226; 

Cost-effective purchasing and efficient distribution. We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitive-pricing provider of dental and animal health products. We distribute our products from strategically located fulfillment centers. We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt and complete order fulfillment. 

Business Strategy 

Our objective is to continue to expand as a leading value-added distributor of dental and animal health products and services. To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Emphasizing our value-added, full-service capabilities . We are positioned to meet virtually all of the needs of dental practitioners, veterinarians, production animal operators and animal health product retailers by providing a broad range of consumable supplies, technology, equipment and software and value-added services. We believe our knowledgeable sales representatives can create special relationships with customers by providing an informational link to the overall industry. Our value-added strategy is further supported by our equipment specialists who offer consultation on design, equipment requirements and financing, our service technicians who perform equipment installation, maintenance and repair services, our business development professionals who provide business tools and educational programs to our customers, and our technology advisors who provide guidance on integrating technology solutions. 

&#8226; 

Using technology to enhance customer service. As part of our commitment to providing superior customer service, we offer our customers easy order placement. Although we offer computerized order entry systems that we believe help establish relationships with new customers and increase loyalty among existing customers, predominant platforms for ordering today include www.pattersondental.com, www.pattersonvet.com and www.animalhealthinternational.com. The use of these methods of ordering enables our sales representatives to spend more time with existing and prospective customers. Our Internet environment includes order entry, customer support for digital and our proprietary products, customer-loyalty program reports and services, and access to articles and manufacturers&#8217; product information. We also provide real-time customer and sales information to our sales force, managers and vendors via the Internet. In addition, we believe that the Patterson Technology Center (the &#8220;PTC&#8221;) differentiates Patterson from our competition by positioning Patterson as the only single-source solution for digital components. In addition to trouble-shooting through the PTC&#8217;s support center, customers can access various service capabilities offered by the PTC, including electronic claims and statement processing and system back-up capabilities. 

&#8226; 

Continuing to improve operating efficiencies. We continue to implement programs designed to improve our operating efficiencies and allow for continued sales growth. This strategy includes our continuing investment in management information systems and consolidation and leveraging of fulfillment centers and sales branches between our operating segments. In addition, we have established shared sales branch offices in several locations. 

&#8226; 

Growing through internal expansion and acquisitions . We intend to continue to grow by hiring established sales representatives, hiring and training skilled sales professionals, opening additional sales offices as needed, and acquiring other distributors in order to enter new, or more deeply penetrate existing, geographic markets, gain access to additional product lines, and expand our customer base. We believe both of our operating segments are well positioned to take advantage of expected continued consolidation in our markets. 

Dental Supply Segment - Products, Services and Sources of Supply 

Patterson Dental, one of the two largest distributors of dental products in North America, has operations in the U.S. and Canada. As a full-service, value-added supplier to over 120,000 dentists, dental laboratories, institutions, and other healthcare professionals, Patterson Dental provides consumable products (including infection control, restorative materials, hand instruments and sterilization products); basic and advanced technology dental equipment; exclusive, innovative technology solutions, including practice management software and e-commerce solutions; patient education systems; and office forms and stationery. Patterson Dental offers customers more than 90,000 SKUs of which approximately 5,000 are private-label products sold under the Patterson brand. Patterson Dental also offers customers a range of related services including software and design services, maintenance and repair, and equipment financing. Net sales of this segment were $2.5 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 and operating income from this segment was $312 million &#32;for the same period. 

The following table sets forth the percentage of total sales by the principal categories of products and services offered to our dental segment customers: &#32;

Patterson Dental obtains products from more than 800 vendors. Although our relationships with most vendors are non-exclusive, we do obtain certain products on an exclusive basis. For example, we have an exclusive distribution agreement with an entity now known as Dentsply Sirona, Inc., the manufacturer of the CEREC &#174; &#32;dental restorative systems and Schick &#174; &#32;digital x-rays, in addition to panoramic and cone beam radiography products. While Patterson Dental makes purchases from many suppliers, and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable. Our top ten supply vendors accounted for approximately 57% and 61% of the cost of dental products sold in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. Of these ten, the top two vendors accounted for 25% and 7% for fiscal 2016 and 18% and 8% for fiscal 2015 cost of sales, respectively. 

Animal Health Supply Segment - Products, Services and Sources of Supply 

Patterson Animal Health is a leading distributor of animal health products in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We sell more than 100,000 SKUs sourced from over 3,400 manufacturers to over 50,000 customers in the highly fragmented animal health supply market. Products we distribute include pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, prescription and non-prescription diets, nutritionals, consumable supplies, equipment and software. We offer a private label portfolio of products to veterinarians, producers, and retailers through our Aspen, First Companion and Patterson Veterinary brands. We also provide a range of value-added services to our animal health customers. Within our companion animal market, our principal customers are companion-pet and equine veterinarians, veterinary clinics, public and private institutions, and shelters. In our production animal market, our principal customers are large animal veterinarians, production animal operators and animal health product retailers. Net sales of this segment were $ 2.9 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 and operating income from this segment was $ 94 million &#32;for the same period.

Patterson Animal Health obtains products from nearly 2,600 vendors in the U.S. and Canada and nearly 900 vendors in the U.K. While Patterson Animal Health makes purchases from many vendors and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products, the concentration of business with key vendors is considerable. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, Patterson Animal Health&#8217;s top 10 animal health supply manufacturers comprised approximately 70% of the total cost of animal health supply sales, and the single largest supplier comprised 17% of the total cost of animal health supply sales. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

During fiscal 2016, we sold products or services to over 170,000 customers who made one or more purchases during the year. Our customers include dentists, laboratories, institutions, other healthcare professionals, veterinarians, other animal health professionals, production animal operators and animal health product retailers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of sales during fiscal 2016, and we are not dependent on any single customer or geographic group of customers. 

We have offices throughout the U.S. and Canada so that we can provide a presence in the market and decision-making near the customer. Patterson Animal Health also has a central office in the U.K. These offices, or sales branches, are staffed with a complete complement of our capabilities, including sales, customer service and technical service personnel, as well as a local manager who has broad decision-making authority with regard to customer-related transactions and issues. 

A primary component of our value-added approach is our sales force. Due to the fragmented nature of the markets we serve, we believe that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service. Sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry, assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories. Our need for a large dedicated sales force in the U.K. is reduced due to the presence of buying groups and corporate customers as well as the significant number of orders placed electronically in the U.K. 

In the U.S., customer service representatives in call centers work in tandem with our sales representatives, providing a dual coverage approach for individual customers. In addition to processing orders, customer service representatives are responsible for assisting customers with ordering, informing customers of monthly promotions, and responding to general inquiries. In the U.K., our customer service team is primarily responsible for handling customer inquiries and resolving issues. 

To assist our customers with their purchasing decisions, we provide a multi-touch point shopping experience. From print to digital, this seamless experience is inclusive of products and services information. Patterson offers online and in-print showcases of our expansive merchandise and equipment offerings, including digital imaging and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing ("CAD/CAM") technologies, hand-held and similar instruments, sundries, office design, e-services, repair and support assistance, as well as financial services. We also promote select products and services through our monthly magazine, Insight , in the U.S. and Canada, and our quarterly magazine, The Cube , in the U.K. Additional direct marketing tools that we utilize include customer loyalty programs, social media, and participation in trade shows. 

We believe that responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment is key to customer satisfaction. We ship consumable supplies from our strategically located fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.K., orders are accepted in a centralized fulfillment center and shipped nationwide to one of our depots located throughout the country at which pre-packed orders are sorted by route for delivery to customers. Orders for consumable supplies can be placed through our sales representatives, customer service representatives or electronically 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Rapid and accurate order fulfillment is another principal component of our value-added approach. 

In order to assure the availability of our broad product lines for prompt delivery to customers, we must maintain sufficient inventories at our fulfillment centers. Purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized, and our purchasing department uses a real-time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels. Our inventory consists mostly of consumable supply items and pharmaceutical products. Additionally, in this competitive market, some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments to maintain exclusivity. 

Geographic Information 

For information on revenues and long-lived assets of our dental and animal health segments by geographic area, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Discontinued Operations 

In August 2015, we sold Patterson Medical Holdings, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary responsible for our rehabilitation supply business known as Patterson Medical, for $717 million in cash to Madison Dearborn Partners. For a limited period of time following the disposition, Patterson will continue to provide certain transition services to Patterson Medical, as owned by Madison Dearborn Partners, pursuant to a transition services agreement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Seasonality 

Our business in general is not seasonal; however, there are some products that typically sell more often during the winter or summer season. In any given month, unusual weather patterns (e.g., unusually hot or cold weather) could impact the sales volumes of these products, either positively or negatively. 

Governmental Regulation 

Operating, Security and Licensure Standards 

Our dental and animal health supply businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Among the U.S. federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations. 

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state. Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as &#8220;HCT/P products.&#8221; 

The federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law. Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (&#8220;DSCSA&#8221;), will be phased in over 10 years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the U.S. The law&#8217;s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs began to take effect in January 2015. The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements. Also in January 2015, the DSCSA required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a &#8220;suspect&#8221; or &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; product, and handle it accordingly. 

The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (&#8220;3PLs&#8221;), and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities. The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs. Beginning January 1, 2015, the DSCSA required wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports to the FDA, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information. According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area. Current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA. 

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (&#8220;FDAAA&#8221;) and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (&#8220;FDASIA&#8221;) amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a Unique Device Identification System. The FDA issued a final rule in September 2013 implementing the Unique Device Identification System, requiring the labels of most medical devices to bear a unique device identifier (&#8220;UDI&#8221;), and prescribing the content and format of the UDI. The rule also requires the submission of certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database (&#8220;GUDID&#8221;). Additional FDA UDI guidance has subsequently been issued, and the FDA&#8217;s UDI regulations are being phased in over seven years from the rule&#8217;s promulgation in September 2013, beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices. For the lowest-risk, Class I medical devices, a Universal Product Code may take the place of a UDI on the device&#8217;s label. 

The FDA&#8217;s UDI regulations require certain entities, referred to as &#8220;labelers,&#8221; to develop and include UDIs on the labels of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs. Labelers are entities that cause a device&#8217;s label to be applied or modified, without any subsequent replacement or modification. Typically, these entities are device manufacturers, specification developers, single-use device reprocessors, convenience kit assemblers, repackagers and relabelers. 

Violations of the UDI regulations, including failure to include a UDI on a device&#8217;s label after the effective date for the device type, result in the misbranding of the device. The FDC Act makes it unlawful to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded device. It is also unlawful to cause a device to become misbranded. 

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;) permitting us to handle controlled 

substances. We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times. We are subject to inspection by the DEA. 

Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale. These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment. In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue. We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our fulfillment centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign powers. Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm. Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation. 

Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions. There have also been increasing efforts by various levels of government globally to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. 

Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors. 

Health Care Fraud 

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Some of these laws, referred to as &#8220;false claims laws,&#8221; prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as &#8220;anti-kickback laws,&#8221; prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. 

Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. 

Health Care Reform 

The U.S. Health Care Reform Law adopted through the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. 

A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. On February 1, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) released the final rule to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Under this rule, data collection activities began on August 1, 2013, and as required under the Physician 

Payment Sunshine Act, CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities. 

Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. Our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us. 

Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records 

The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of medical device software, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices. Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products. 

In addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies. For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;). HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. 

We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers&#8217; comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation. 

International Transactions 

In addition, U.S. and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the U.S. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

Proprietary Rights 

We hold trademarks relating to the &#8220;Patterson&#174;&#8221; name and logo, as well as certain other trademarks. Our U.S. trademark registrations have 10-year terms, and may be renewed for additional 10-year terms. We intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable. 

Employees 

As of April 30, 2016, we had approximately 7,000 full-time employees. We have not experienced a shortage of qualified personnel in the past and believe that we will be able to attract such employees in the future. We believe our relations with employees to be good.
