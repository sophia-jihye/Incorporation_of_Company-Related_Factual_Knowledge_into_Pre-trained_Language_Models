Supervision and Regulation of the Company 

M&#38;T and its subsidiaries are subject to the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries. Regulation of financial institutions such as M&#38;T and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC&#146;s Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking and financial system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors. 

Proposals to change the applicable regulatory framework may be introduced in the United States Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to M&#38;T or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company. 

Significant changes in this regulatory scheme arising from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) has affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, and the system of regulatory oversight of the Company. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, various federal regulatory agencies have proposed or adopted a broad range of implementing rules and regulations and have prepared numerous studies and reports for Congress. However, given that many of these regulatory changes are highly complex and are not fully implemented, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations. 

&#160; 

Described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to M&#38;T and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. 

Overview 

M&#38;T is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;) as a BHC under the BHCA. As such, M&#38;T and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHCA and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. Its investment advisor subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulation. 

In general, the BHCA limits the business of a BHC to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies are to serve as a managerial and financial source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions, including committing resources to support its subsidiary banks. This support may be required at times when M&#38;T may not be inclined or able to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a BHC&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation or order, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity or to acquire a company engaged in any activity pursuant to the financial holding company provisions of the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company also must have at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the &#147;CRA&#148;). See the section captioned &#147;Community Reinvestment Act&#148; included elsewhere in this item. 

To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#147;well capitalized&#148; and &#147;well managed.&#148; M&#38;T became a financial holding company on March 1, 2011. The failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of M&#38;T and may also adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, as well as loss of financial holding company status. 

Current federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation under which, in addition to the broad supervisory authority that the Federal Reserve Board has over both the banking and non-banking activities of bank holding companies, the federal banking agencies regulate the banking activities of bank holding companies, banks and savings associations and subsidiaries of the foregoing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) regulates their securities activities, and state insurance regulators regulate their insurance activities. 

M&#38;T Bank is a New York chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As a result, it is subject to extensive regulation, examination and oversight by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve. New York laws and regulations govern many aspects of M&#38;T Bank&#146;s operations, including branching, dividends, subsidiary activities, fiduciary activities, lending, and deposit taking. M&#38;T Bank is also subject to Federal Reserve regulations and guidance, including oversight of capital levels. Its deposits are insured by the FDIC to $250,000 per depositor, which also exercises regulatory oversight over certain aspects of M&#38;T Bank&#146;s operations. Certain subsidiaries of M&#38;T Bank are subject to regulation by other federal and state regulators as well. For example, M&#38;T Securities is regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators, and WT Investment Advisors is also subject to SEC regulation. 

&#160; 

Wilmington Trust, N.A. is a national bank with operations that include fiduciary and related activities with some limited lending and deposit business. It is subject to extensive regulation, examination and oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which governs many aspects of the operations, including fiduciary activities, capital levels, office locations, dividends and subsidiary activities. Its deposits are insured by the FDIC to $250,000 per depositor, which also exercises regulatory oversight over certain aspects of the operations of Wilmington Trust, N.A. Certain subsidiaries of Wilmington Trust, N.A. are subject to regulation by other federal and state regulators as well. 

The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments which are based on average consolidated total assets less average Tier 1 capital and certain allowable deductions of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions. 

Dividends 

M&#38;T is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. Historically, the majority of M&#38;T&#146;s revenue has been from dividends paid to M&#38;T by its subsidiary banks. M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. are subject to laws and regulations imposing restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay. Future dividend payments to M&#38;T by its subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors, including the earnings and financial condition of each such bank, and are subject to the limitations referred to in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#148; and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies. 

An insured depository institution is prohibited from making any capital distribution to its owner, including any dividend, if, after making such distribution, the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure, including the risk-based capital adequacy and leverage standards discussed herein. 

Dividend payments by M&#38;T to its shareholders and stock repurchases by M&#38;T are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board. As described below in this section under &#147;Stress Testing and Capital Plan Review,&#148; dividends and stock repurchases (net of any new stock issuances as per a capital plan) generally may only be paid or made under a capital plan as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. 

Capital Requirements 

M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. Beginning on January 1, 2015, M&#38;T and its subsidiary banks became subject to a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that was issued by the federal banking agencies in July 2013 (the &#147;New Capital Rules&#148;), subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. 

The New Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee&#146;s December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#147;Basel III&#148; for strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including M&#38;T, M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A., as compared to the U.S. general risk-based capital rules that were applicable to the Company through December 31, 2014. The New Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. 

Among other matters, the New Capital Rules: (i) introduce a capital measure called &#147;Common Equity Tier 1&#148; (&#147;CET1&#148;) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#147;Additional Tier 1 capital&#148; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to the previous regulations. Under the New Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including M&#38;T, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the New Capital Rules&#146; specific requirements. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows: 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;). 

The New Capital Rules also introduce a new &#147;capital conservation buffer,&#148; composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the capital standards applicable to M&#38;T will include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%; (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5% and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. In addition, M&#38;T is also subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s capital plan rule and supervisory Capital Analysis and Review (&#147;CCAR&#148;) process, pursuant to which its ability to make capital distributions and repurchase or redeem capital securities may be limited unless M&#38;T is able to demonstrate its ability to meet applicable minimum capital ratios and currently a 5% minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio, as well as other requirements, over a nine quarter planning horizon under a &#147;severely adverse&#148; macroeconomic scenario generated yearly by the federal bank regulators. See &#147;Stress Testing and Capital Plan Review&#148; below. 

The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 

In addition, under the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company through December 31, 2014, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#147;AOCI&#148;) items included in shareholders&#146; equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP were reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including M&#38;T, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. M&#38;T made such election in 2015. The New Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from inclusion in bank holding companies&#146; Tier 1 capital, subject to phase-out in the case of bank holding companies, such as M&#38;T, that had $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009. As a result, beginning in 2015 25% of M&#38;T&#146;s trust preferred securities were includable in Tier 1 capital, and in 2016, none of M&#38;T&#146;s trust preferred securities will be includable in Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities no longer included in M&#38;T&#146;s Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out and irrespective of whether such securities otherwise meet the revised definition of Tier 2 capital set forth in the New Capital Rules. Management believes that M&#38;T is in compliance with the targeted capital ratios. M&#38;T&#146;s regulatory capital ratios are presented in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#148; 

Stress Testing and Capital Plan Review 

As part of the enhanced prudential requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions, the Federal Reserve Board conducts annual analyses of bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in assets, such as M&#38;T, to determine whether the companies have sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses in three economic and financial scenarios generated by the Federal Reserve Board: baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios. M&#38;T is also required to conduct its own semi-annual stress analysis (together with the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s stress analysis, the &#147;stress tests&#148;) to assess the potential impact on M&#38;T of the economic and 

&#160; 

financial conditions used as part of the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s annual stress analysis. The Federal Reserve Board may also use, and require companies to use, additional components in the adverse and severely adverse scenarios or additional or more complex scenarios designed to capture salient risks to specific business groups. M&#38;T Bank is also required to conduct annual stress testing using the same economic and financial scenarios as M&#38;T and report the results to the Federal Reserve Board. A summary of results of the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s analysis under the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios are publicly disclosed, and bank holding companies subject to the rules, including M&#38;T, must disclose a summary of the company-run severely adverse stress test results. M&#38;T is required to include in its disclosure a summary of the severely adverse scenario stress test conducted by M&#38;T Bank. 

In addition, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&#38;T, must submit annual capital plans for approval as part of the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s CCAR process. Covered bank holding companies may execute capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing stock, only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Federal Reserve Board (or any approved amendments to such plan). The comprehensive capital plans include a view of capital adequacy under four scenarios &#151; a BHC-defined baseline scenario, a baseline scenario provided by the Federal Reserve Board, at least one BHC-defined stress scenario, and a stress scenario provided by the Federal Reserve Board. The CCAR process is intended to help ensure that these bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company&#146;s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. Each of the bank holding companies participating in the CCAR process is also required to collect and report certain related data to the Federal Reserve Board on a quarterly basis to allow the Federal Reserve Board to monitor progress against the approved capital plans. Each capital plan must include a view of capital adequacy under the stress test scenarios described above. The Federal Reserve Board may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will maintain a Tier 1 common equity ratio (as defined under the Basel I framework) of at least 5% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan. Even if such quantitative thresholds are met, the Federal Reserve Board could object to a capital plan for qualitative reasons, including inadequate assumptions in the plan, other unresolved supervisory issues or an insufficiently robust capital adequacy process, or if the capital plan would otherwise constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or violate law. The rules also provide that a covered BHC may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and have a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at least 5%. The CCAR rules, consistent with prior Federal Reserve Board guidance, also provide that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of net income will receive particularly close scrutiny. M&#38;T&#146;s most recent CCAR capital plan was filed with the Federal Reserve Board on January 5, 2015, and the next submission is due on April 5, 2016. 

The Federal Reserve Board generally limits a BHC&#146;s ability to make quarterly capital distributions &#150; that is, dividends and share repurchases, if the amount of the BHC&#146;s actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the BHC had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve Board. For example, if the BHC issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued (&#147;net distributions&#148;), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. However, not raising sufficient amounts of common stock as planned would not affect distributions related to Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and/ or Tier 2 Capital. These limitations also contain several important qualifications and exceptions, including that scheduled dividend payments on (as opposed to repurchases of) a BHC&#146;s Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital instruments are not restricted if the BHC fails to issue a sufficient amount of such instruments as planned, as well as provisions for certain de minimis excess distributions. 

&#160; 

Liquidity 

Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and BHC liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and internationally, without required formulaic measures. However, beginning in January 2016 M&#38;T is subject to final rules adopted by the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators (&#147;Final LCR Rule&#148;) implementing a U.S. version of the Basel Committee&#146;s Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement (&#147;LCR&#148;). The LCR is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of so-called &#147;high quality liquid assets&#148; (&#147;HQLA&#148;) to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is the ratio of an institution&#146;s amount of HQLA (the numerator) over projected net cash out-flows over the 30-day horizon (the denominator), in each case, as calculated pursuant to the Final LCR Rule. Once fully phased-in, a subject institution must maintain an LCR equal to at least 100% in order to satisfy this regulatory requirement. Only specific classes of assets, including U.S. Treasury securities, other U.S. government obligations and agency mortgaged-backed securities, qualify under the rule as HQLA, with classes of assets deemed relatively less liquid and/or subject to greater degree of credit risk subject to certain haircuts and caps for purposes of calculating the numerator under the Final LCR Rule. The total net cash outflows amount is determined under the rule by applying certain hypothetical outflow and inflow rates, which reflect certain standardized stressed assumptions, against the balances of the banking organization&#146;s funding sources, obligations, transactions and assets over the 30-day stress period. Inflows that can be included to offset outflows are limited to 75% of outflows (which effectively means that banking organizations must hold high-quality liquid assets equal to 25% of outflows even if outflows perfectly match inflows over the stress period). The total net cash outflow amount for the modified LCR applicable to M&#38;T is capped at 70% of the outflow rate that applies to the full LCR. The initial compliance date for the modified LCR was January 1, 2016, with the requirement fully phased-in by January 1, 2017. 

The Basel III framework also included a second standard, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (&#147;NSFR&#148;), which is designed to promote more medium-and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time horizon. Although the Basel Committee finalized its formulation of the NSFR in 2014, the U.S. banking agencies have not yet proposed an NSFR for application to U.S. banking organizations or addressed the scope of banking organizations to which it will apply. The Basel Committee&#146;s final NSFR document states that the NSFR applies to internationally active banks, as did its final LCR document as to that ratio. 

Cross-Guarantee Provisions 

Each insured depository institution &#147;controlled&#148; (as defined in the BHCA) by the same BHC can be held liable to the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any other insured depository institution controlled by that holding company and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of those banks that are in danger of default. The FDIC&#146;s claim under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company and to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution, but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the DIF. 

Enhanced Supervision and Prudential Standards 

The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to enact enhanced prudential standards applicable to foreign banking organizations and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&#38;T. The Federal Reserve Board adopted amendments to Regulation YY to implement certain of the required enhanced prudential standards. Those amendments, which are intended to help increase the resiliency of the operations of these organizations, include liquidity requirements, requirements for overall risk management (including establishing a risk committee), and a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability. The liquidity requirements and risk management requirements became effective as to M&#38;T on January 1, 2015. The Federal Reserve Board has not yet adopted final single counterparty credit limits or early remediation requirements. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule 

On December 10, 2013, the federal banking regulators and the SEC adopted the so-called Volcker Rule to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act limiting proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds (defined as covered funds in the Volcker Rule). The Company does not engage in any significant amount of proprietary trading as defined in the Volcker Rule and has implemented the required procedures for those areas in which trading does occur. The covered funds limits are imposed through a conformance period that is expected to end in July 2017. The Company is required to divest of certain assets that constitute covered funds; however these divestitures are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

Safety and Soundness Standards 

Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the &#147;FDIA&#148;), establish general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. Additionally, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 

Limits on Undercapitalized Depository Institutions 

The FDIA establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions, referred to as the prompt corrective action. The federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (&#147;well-capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; and &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;) and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The FDIC has specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category. The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have specified the same or similar levels for each category. Effective January 1, 2015, the New Capital Rules created new prompt corrective action requirements by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8%; and (iii) eliminating the provision that provided that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. 

An institution that is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital levels may be classified as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. 

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a BHC must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The 

&#160; 

BHC must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a controlling BHC under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an undercapitalized subsidiary&#146;s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which M&#38;T and its non-bank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. In general, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Board Act and Federal Reserve Board Regulation W require that any &#147;covered transaction&#148; by M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. (or any of their respective subsidiaries) with an affiliate must in certain cases be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited as follows: (a) in the case of any single such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution, and (b) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries may not exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of such insured depository institution. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization, including for example, the requirement that the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries. &#147;Covered transactions&#148; are defined by statute to include, among other things, a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. All covered transactions, including certain additional transactions (such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest), must be conducted on market terms. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

Deposit Insurance Assessments . M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. pay deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on an assessment rate established by the FDIC. Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity. For larger institutions, such as M&#38;T Bank, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank&#146;s capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution&#146;s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. 

The initial base assessment rate ranges from 5 to 35 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 2.5 to 45 basis points on an annualized basis. As the DIF reserve ratio grows, the rate schedule will be adjusted downward. Additionally, an institution must pay an additional premium equal to 50 basis points on every dollar (above 3% of an institution&#146;s Tier 1 capital) of long-term, unsecured debt held that was issued by another insured depository institution. 

In its DIF restoration plan, the FDIC designated that the DIF reserve ratio should be 1.35% by September 2020. The FDIC will, at least semi-annually, update its income and loss projections for the DIF and, if necessary, propose rules to further increase assessment rates. 

&#160; 

Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

FICO Assessments . In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) to impose assessments on DIF applicable deposits in order to service the interest on FICO&#146;s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount assessed on individual institutions by FICO is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. FICO assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change in assessment base. M&#38;T Bank recognized $5 million of expense related to its FICO assessments and Wilmington Trust, N.A. recognized $73 thousand of such expense in 2015. 

Acquisitions 

The BHCA requires every BHC to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before: (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition, the BHC will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the voting shares of the institution; (2) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association; or (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other BHC. Since July 2011, financial holding companies and bank holding companies with consolidated assets exceeding $50 billion, such as M&#38;T, have been required to (i) obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion and (ii) provide prior written notice to the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company having consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. 

The BHCA further provides that the Federal Reserve Board may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve Board is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties&#146; performance under the CRA and compliance with consumer protection laws. The Federal Reserve Board must take into account the institutions&#146; effectiveness in combating money laundering. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHCA was amended to require the Federal Reserve Board, when evaluating a proposed transaction, to consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. 

Executive and Incentive Compensation 

Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. The Federal Reserve Board has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies (the &#147;Incentive Compensation Guidance&#148;) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of 

&#160; 

directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, discussed below. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The Incentive Compensation Guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as M&#38;T and M&#38;T Bank, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, and if the final regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which M&#38;T may structure compensation for its executives. 

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#146; policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of M&#38;T and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees. 

Resolution Planning 

Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&#38;T, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. M&#38;T&#146;s resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. The regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan&#146;s components, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the company&#146;s organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. In addition, insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as M&#38;T Bank, are required to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution&#146;s failure. M&#38;T and M&#38;T Bank submitted updated resolution plans in December 2015. 

Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company 

If the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as M&#38;T Bank or Wilmington Trust, N.A., upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power: 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; to transfer any of the depository institution&#146;s assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed &#147;bridge&#148; bank without the approval of the depository institution&#146;s creditors; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; to enforce the terms of the depository institution&#146;s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution. 

In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution, in the &#147;liquidation or other resolution&#148; of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of M&#38;T Bank or Wilmington Trust, N.A., the debt holders would be treated differently from, and could 

&#160; 

receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors of the bank. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime (known as &#147;orderly liquidation authority&#148;) for systemically important financial companies, including bank holding companies and their affiliates. Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution, and its failed subsidiaries, for purposes of liquidating the entity if, among other conditions, it is determined at the time of the institution&#146;s failure that it is in default or in danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. 

If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under the Dodd-Frank Act provisions, and not under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA. However, the provisions governing the rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation authority were modified in certain respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of creditors&#146; claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as compared to the treatment of those claims under the new authority. Nonetheless, substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist as between these two regimes, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors&#146; claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a &#147;bridge&#148; entity. 

An orderly liquidation fund will fund such liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the Treasury Department and risk-based assessments made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&#38;T. If an orderly liquidation is triggered, M&#38;T could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund. 

The FDIC has developed a strategy under the orderly liquidation authority referred to as the &#147;single point of entry&#148; strategy, under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets (including shares of its operating subsidiaries) and, potentially, very limited liabilities to a &#147;bridge&#148; holding company; utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries; and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company. Under this strategy, management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and shareholders and creditors of the failed financial holding company would bear the losses resulting from the failure. 

Depositor Preference 

Under federal law, depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the &#147;liquidation or other resolution&#148; of such an institution by any receiver. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent BHC, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 

Financial Privacy 

The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information 

&#160; 

from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 

Consumer Protection Laws and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision 

In connection with their respective lending and leasing activities, M&#38;T Bank, Wilmington Trust, N.A. and certain of their subsidiaries, are each subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and various state law counterparts. They are also subject to consumer protections laws governing their deposit taking activities, as well securities and insurance laws governing certain aspects of their consolidated operations. The CFPB issued new integrated disclosure requirements under the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act that became effective in October 2015. These requirements impose new timelines for the provision of disclosures to borrowers. 

The Dodd-Frank Act established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (&#147;CFPB&#148;) with broad powers to supervise and enforce most federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit &#147;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#148; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, including M&#38;T Bank. 

The CFPB has focused on: 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; depository institutions with a more specialized focus; and 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. 

The Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines (&#147;ATM&#148;) and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those type of transactions. If a consumer does not opt in, any ATM transaction or debit that overdraws the consumer&#146;s account will be denied. Overdrafts on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments are not covered by this rule. Before opting in, the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution&#146;s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service, and the consumer&#146;s choices. Financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms, conditions and features (including pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

M&#38;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. are subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank&#146;s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these examinations, the regulatory agency rates such bank&#146;s compliance with the CRA as &#147;Outstanding,&#148; &#147;Satisfactory,&#148; &#147;Needs to Improve&#148; or &#147;Substantial Noncompliance.&#148; The regulatory agency&#146;s assessment of the institution&#146;s record is part of the regulatory agency&#146;s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, or to open or relocate a branch office. Currently, M&#38;T Bank has a CRA rating of &#147;Outstanding&#148; and Wilmington Trust, N.A. has a CRA rating of &#147;Satisfactory.&#148; In the case of a BHC applying for approval to acquire a bank or BHC, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the 

&#160; 

applicant BHC in considering the application, and such records may be the basis for denying the application. The Banking Law contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New York-chartered banks. Currently, M&#38;T Bank has a CRA rating of &#147;Outstanding&#148; as determined by the New York State Department of Financial Services. 

Bank Secrecy and Anti-Money Laundering 

Federal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker/dealer subsidiaries, to implement and maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism and to verify the identity of their customers. In addition, these provisions require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#146;s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. As a result of an inspection by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (&#147;Federal Reserve Bank&#148;), M&#38;T and M&#38;T Bank entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank related to M&#38;T Bank&#146;s Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Program. Additional information is included in Part II, Item 7 under the caption &#147;Regulatory Oversight.&#148; 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#147;OFAC&#148; rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#147;U.S. persons&#148; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g. property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Regulation of Insurers and Insurance Brokers 

The Company&#146;s operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws generally grant broad discretion to regulatory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Certain of M&#38;T&#146;s insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory supervision and to insurance laws and regulations requiring, among other things, maintenance of capital, record keeping, reporting and examinations. 

Federal Reserve Policies 

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of 

&#160; 

the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on the Company&#146;s business and earnings. 

Competition 

The Company competes in offering commercial and personal financial services with other banking institutions and with firms in a number of other industries, such as thrift institutions, credit unions, personal loan companies, sales finance companies, leasing companies, securities firms and insurance companies. Furthermore, diversified financial services companies are able to offer a combination of these services to their customers on a nationwide basis. The Company&#146;s operations are significantly impacted by state and federal regulations applicable to the banking industry. Moreover, the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Interstate Banking Act and the Banking Law have allowed for increased competition among diversified financial services providers.
