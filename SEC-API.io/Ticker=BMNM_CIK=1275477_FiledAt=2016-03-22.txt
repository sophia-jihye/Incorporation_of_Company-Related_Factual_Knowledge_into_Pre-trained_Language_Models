 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Year 2015 Significant Events 

Bimini Capital Management, Inc., &#160; a Maryland corporation (&#8220;Bimini Capital&#8221; and, collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), has historically been organized, operated and taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). As of December 31, 2014, our corporate structure included two taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRS&#8221;), and until its deconsolidation on December 31, 2014, a separately taxed REIT subsidiary, Orchid Island Capital, Inc. (&#8220;Orchid&#8221;). 

Certain trends and events experienced during 2015 have caused Bimini Capital to no longer meet the Code&#8217;s rules and regulations to be taxed as a REIT, effective January 1, 2015. In particular, additional offerings of common stock by Orchid in 2015 increased revenue attributable to management fees received from Orchid. In addition, payments that have been and will be made by Bimini Capital pursuant to a litigation settlement agreement entered into in 2015 have reduced and may continue to reduce the value of Bimini Capital&#8217;s assets and the amount of revenues generated by our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Consequently, the value of our two TRSs has increased in relation to the value of Bimini Capital&#8217;s assets to a level that exceeds the limits permitted for a REIT under the Code. 

The failure to qualify as a REIT subjects Bimini Capital&#8217;s taxable income to federal and state corporate income taxes at regular corporate rates. However, Bimini Capital and its subsidiaries have NOL carryforwards that we believe will be available to offset taxable income, if any, in 2015 and in future periods. Management is implementing certain internal restructuring transactions that would maximize its ability to utilize the existing federal NOL carryforwards. 

In addition, the termination of our REIT status eliminates the income, asset, distribution, and stock ownership requirements applicable to REITs, which will provide us with more flexibility in executing our business strategy. Specifically, because we are no longer required to derive a significant portion of our income from mortgage or other real estate related investments, we will have greater flexibility to invest in other types of assets as part of our principal investing activity, subject to maintaining compliance with our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;). In addition, because we will no longer be subject to the REIT distribution requirement, we will have greater flexibility to retain our earnings to fund future growth. 

Overview 

Bimini Capital is a specialty finance company that primarily invests in mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;). The principal and interest payments of these MBS are guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) or the Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221; and, collectively with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, &#8220;GSEs&#8221;) and are backed primarily by single-family residential mortgage loans. We refer to these types of MBS as Agency MBS. Our investment strategy focuses on, and our portfolio consists of, two categories of Agency MBS: (i) traditional pass-through Agency MBS and (ii) structured Agency MBS, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), interest only securities (&#8220;IOs&#8221;), inverse interest only securities (&#8220;IIOs&#8221;) and principal only (&#8220;POs&#8221;), among other types of structured Agency MBS. &#160; Bimini Capital&#8217;s website is located at http://www.biminicapital.com . Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Beginning in 2013, and as further described below, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, also began to serve as the external manager of Orchid, and from this arrangement the Company receives management fees and expense reimbursements. In addition, the Company receives dividends from its investment in Orchid common shares. The Company is self-managed and self-advised.

As used in this document, references to &#8220;Bimini Capital,&#8221; the parent company, and to or the general management of Bimini Capital&#8217;s portfolio of MBS refer to Bimini Capital Management, Inc. Orchid completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock effective February 20, 2013. After that date, and until December 31, 2014, Orchid continued to be consolidated as a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) as described below. As used in this document, discussions related to REIT qualifying activities include the MBS portfolios of both Bimini Capital and Orchid through December 31, 2014. References to Bimini Capital&#8217;s taxable REIT subsidiaries or non-REIT eligible assets refer to Bimini Advisors, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (together as &#8220;Bimini Advisors&#8221;) and to MortCo TRS, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;MortCo&#8221;). 

Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bimini Capital, Bimini Advisors and MortCo. The accounts of Orchid are included in the consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows until December 31, 2014. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. 

Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 810, Consolidation (&#8220;ASC 810&#8221;), requires the consolidation of a VIE by an enterprise if it is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Further, ASC 810 requires a qualitative assessment to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, and additional disclosures for entities that have variable interests in VIEs. 

From the effective date of Orchid&#8217;s IPO and until December 31, 2014, management concluded pursuant to ASC 810 that Orchid was a VIE. As a result, subsequent to Orchid&#8217;s IPO and until December 31, 2014, the Company consolidated Orchid in its financial statements. The results of operations of Orchid are included in the Company&#8217;s 2014 consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, however, net income attributable to Bimini Capital stockholders did not include the portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, management re-evaluated the conditions resulting in the consolidation of Orchid and concluded that, due to Bimini&#8217;s decreased percentage ownership interest in Orchid, there was no longer a variable interest requiring consolidation. As a result, in accordance with ASC 810, the Company has deconsolidated Orchid from the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. However, as a VIE which was deconsolidated on December 31, 2014, Orchid&#8217;s results of operations were included in the consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows through December 31, 2014, and are excluded in subsequent periods. 

Our Investment and Capital Allocation Strategy 

Investment Strategy 

Our business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total returns to our investors over the long term through a combination of capital appreciation and the payment of regular monthly distributions. We intend to achieve this objective by investing in and strategically allocating capital between pass-through Agency MBS and structured Agency MBS. We seek to generate income from (i) the net interest margin on our leveraged pass-through Agency MBS portfolio and the leveraged portion of our structured Agency MBS portfolio, and (ii) the interest income we generate from the unleveraged portion of our structured Agency MBS portfolio. We also seek to minimize the volatility of both the net asset value of, and income from, our portfolio through a process which emphasizes capital allocation, asset selection, liquidity and active interest rate risk management. 

We fund our pass-through Agency MBS and certain of our structured Agency MBS, such as fixed and floating rate tranches of CMOs and POs, through repurchase agreements. However, we generally do not employ leverage on our structured Agency MBS that have no principal balance, such as IOs and IIOs. We may pledge a portion of these assets to increase our cash balance, but we do not intend to invest the cash derived from pledging the assets. Otherwise, we do not use leverage in these instances because the securities contain structural leverage. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our target asset categories and principal assets in which we intend to invest are as follows: 

Pass-through Agency MBS 

We invest in pass-through securities, which are securities secured by residential real property in which payments of both interest and principal on the securities are generally made monthly. In effect, these securities pass through the monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities, net of fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities. Pass-through certificates can be divided into various categories based on the characteristics of the underlying mortgages, such as the term or whether the interest rate is fixed or variable. 

The payment of principal and interest on mortgage pass-through securities issued by Ginnie Mae, but not the market value, is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. Payment of principal and interest on mortgage pass-through certificates issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but not the market value, is guaranteed by the respective agency issuing the security. 

A key feature of most mortgage loans is the ability of the borrower to repay principal earlier than scheduled. This is called a prepayment. Prepayments arise primarily due to sale of the underlying property, refinancing or foreclosure. Prepayments result in a return of principal to pass-through certificate holders. This may result in a lower or higher rate of return upon reinvestment of principal. This is generally referred to as prepayment uncertainty. If a security purchased at a premium prepays at a higher-than-expected rate, then the value of the premium would be eroded at a faster-than-expected rate. Similarly, if a discount mortgage prepays at a lower-than-expected rate, the amortization towards par would be accumulated at a slower-than-expected rate. The possibility of these undesirable effects is sometimes referred to as &#8220;prepayment risk.&#8221; 

In general, declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments, and rising interest rates tend to slow prepayments. Like other fixed-income securities, when interest rates rise, the value of Agency MBS generally declines. The rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of Agency MBS and may shorten or extend the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase. If interest rates rise, our holdings of Agency MBS may experience reduced spreads over our funding costs if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated. This is generally referred to as &#8220;extension&#8221; risk. 

The mortgage loans underlying pass-through certificates can generally be classified into the following three categories: 

&#183; 

Fixed-Rate Mortgages . Fixed-rate mortgages are those where the borrower pays an interest rate that is constant throughout the term of the loan. Traditionally, most fixed-rate mortgages have an original term of 30 years. However, shorter terms (also referred to as &#8220;final maturity dates&#8221;) have become common in recent years. Because the interest rate on the loan never changes, even when market interest rates change, there can be a divergence between the interest rate on the loan and current market interest rates over time. This in turn can make fixed-rate mortgages price-sensitive to market fluctuations in interest rates. In general, the longer the remaining term on the mortgage loan, the greater the price sensitivity &#160; to movements in interest rates and, therefore, the likelihood for greater price variability. 

&#183; 

ARMs . ARMs are mortgages for which the borrower pays an interest rate that varies over the term of the loan. The interest rate usually resets based on market interest rates, although the adjustment of such an interest rate may be subject to certain limitations. Traditionally, interest rate resets occur at regular intervals (for example, once per year). We refer to such ARMs as &#8220;traditional&#8221; ARMs. Because the interest rates on ARMs fluctuate based on market conditions, ARMs tend to have interest rates that do not deviate from current market rates by a large amount. This in turn can mean that ARMs have less price sensitivity to interest rates &#160; and, consequently, are less likely to experience significant price volatility. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgages . Hybrid ARMs have a fixed-rate for the first few years of the loan, often three, five, seven or ten years, and thereafter reset periodically like a traditional ARM. Effectively, such mortgages are hybrids, combining the features of a pure fixed-rate mortgage and a traditional ARM. Hybrid ARMs have price sensitivity to interest rates similar to that of a fixed-rate mortgage during the period when the interest rate is fixed and similar to that of an ARM when the interest rate is in its periodic reset stage. However, because many hybrid ARMs are structured with a relatively short initial time span during which the interest rate is fixed, even during that segment of its existence, the price sensitivity may be high. 

Structured Agency MBS 

We also invest in structured Agency MBS, which include CMOs, IOs, IIOs and POs. The payment of principal and interest, as appropriate, on structured Agency MBS issued by Ginnie Mae, but not the market value, is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. Payment of principal and interest, as appropriate, on structured Agency MBS issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but not the market value, is guaranteed by the respective agency issuing the security. The types of structured Agency MBS in which we invest are described below. 

&#183; 

CMOs . CMOs are a type of MBS the principal and interest of which are paid, in most cases, on a monthly basis. CMOs may be collateralized by whole mortgage loans, but are more typically collateralized by portfolios of mortgage pass-through securities issued directly by or under the auspices of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. CMOs are structured into multiple classes, with each class bearing a different stated maturity. Monthly payments of principal, including prepayments, are first returned to investors holding the shortest maturity class. Investors holding the longer maturity classes receive principal only after the first class has been retired. Generally, fixed-rate mortgages are used to collateralize CMOs. However, the CMO tranches need not all have fixed-rate coupons. Some CMO tranches have floating rate coupons that adjust based on market interest rates, subject to some limitations. Such tranches, often called &#8220;CMO floaters,&#8221; can have relatively low price sensitivity to interest rates. 

&#183; 

IOs . IOs represent the stream of interest payments on a pool of mortgages, either fixed-rate mortgages or hybrid ARMs. Holders of IOs have no claim to any principal payments. The value of IOs depends primarily on two factors, which are prepayments and interest rates. Prepayments on the underlying pool of mortgages reduce the stream of interest payments going forward, hence IOs are highly sensitive to prepayment rates. IOs are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. An increase in interest rates reduces the present value of future interest payments on a pool of mortgages. On the other hand, an increase in interest rates has a tendency to reduce prepayments, which increases the expected absolute amount of future interest payments. 

&#183; 

IIOs . IIOs represent the stream of interest payments on a pool of mortgages, either fixed-rate mortgages or hybrid ARMs. Holders of IIOs have no claim to any principal payments. The value of IIOs depends primarily on three factors, which are prepayments, London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) and term interest rates. Prepayments on the underlying pool of mortgages reduce the stream of interest payments, making IIOs highly sensitive to prepayment rates. The coupon on IIOs is derived from both the coupon interest rate on the underlying pool of mortgages and 30-day LIBOR. IIOs are typically created in conjunction with a floating rate CMO that has a principal balance and which is entitled to receive all of the principal payments on the underlying pool of mortgages. The coupon on the floating rate CMO is also based on 30-day LIBOR. Typically, the coupon on the floating rate CMO and the IIO, when combined, equal the coupon on the pool of underlying mortgages. The coupon on the pool of underlying mortgages typically represents a cap or ceiling on the combined coupons of the floating rate CMO and the IIO. Accordingly, when the value of 30-day LIBOR increases, the coupon of the floating rate CMO will increase and the coupon on the IIO will decrease. When the value of 30-day LIBOR falls, the opposite is true. Accordingly, the value of IIOs are sensitive to the level of 30-day LIBOR and expectations by market participants of future movements in the level of 30-day LIBOR. IIOs are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. An increase in interest rates reduces the present value of future interest payments on a pool of mortgages. On the other hand, an increase in interest rates has a tendency to reduce prepayments, which increases the expected absolute amount of future interest payments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

POs . POs represent the stream of principal payments on a pool of mortgages. Holders of POs have no claim to any interest payments, although the ultimate amount of principal to be received over time is known, equaling the principal balance of the underlying pool of mortgages. The timing of the receipt of the principal payments is not known. The value of POs depends primarily on two factors, which are prepayments and interest rates. Prepayments on the underlying pool of mortgages accelerate the stream of principal repayments, making POs highly sensitive to the rate at which the mortgages in the pool are prepaid. POs are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. An increase in interest rates reduces the present value of future principal payments on a pool of mortgages. Further, an increase in interest rates has a tendency to reduce prepayments, which decelerates, or pushes further out in time, the ultimate receipt of the principal payments. The opposite is true when interest rates decline. 

Our investment strategy consists of the following components: 

&#183; 

investing in pass-through Agency MBS and certain structured Agency MBS, such as fixed and floating rate tranches of CMOs and POs, on a leveraged basis to increase returns on the capital allocated to this portfolio; 

&#183; 

investing in certain structured Agency MBS, such as IOs and IIOs, generally on an unleveraged basis in order to (i) increase returns due to the structural leverage contained in such securities, (ii) enhance liquidity due to the fact that these securities will be unencumbered or, when encumbered, the cash from such borrowings may be retained and (iii) diversify portfolio interest rate risk due to the different interest rate sensitivity these securities have compared to pass-through Agency MBS; 

&#183; 

investing in Agency MBS in order to minimize credit risk; 

&#183; 

investing in assets that will cause us to maintain our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

Our management makes investment decisions based on various factors, including, but not limited to, relative value, expected cash yield, supply and demand, costs of hedging, costs of financing, liquidity requirements, expected future interest rate volatility and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves. We do not attribute any particular quantitative significance to any of these factors, and the weight we give to these factors depends on market conditions and economic trends. 

Over time, we will modify our investment strategy as market conditions change to seek to maximize the returns from our investment portfolio. We believe that this strategy will enable us to provide attractive long-term returns to our stockholders. 

Capital Allocation Strategy 

The percentage of capital invested in our two asset categories will vary and will be managed in an effort to maintain the level of income generated by the combined portfolios, the stability of that income stream and the stability of the value of the combined portfolios. Typically, pass-through Agency MBS and structured Agency MBS exhibit materially different sensitivities to movements in interest rates. Declines in the value of one portfolio may be offset by appreciation in the other, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case. Additionally, we will seek to maintain adequate liquidity as we allocate capital. 

We allocate our capital to assist our interest rate risk management efforts. The unleveraged portfolio does not require unencumbered cash or cash equivalents to be maintained in anticipation of possible margin calls. To the extent more capital is deployed in the unleveraged portfolio, our liquidity needs will generally be less. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

During periods of rising interest rates, refinancing opportunities available to borrowers typically decrease because borrowers are not able to refinance their current mortgage loans with new mortgage loans at lower interest rates. In such instances, securities that are highly sensitive to refinancing activity, such as IOs and IIOs, typically increase in value. Our capital allocation strategy allows us to redeploy our capital into such securities when and if we believe interest rates will be higher in the future, thereby allowing us to hold securities the value of which we believe is likely to increase as interest rates rise. Also, by being able to re-allocate capital into structured Agency MBS, such as IOs, during periods of rising interest rates, we may be able to offset the likely decline in the value of our pass-through Agency MBS, which are negatively impacted by rising interest rates. 

Financing Strategy 

We borrow against our Agency MBS and certain of our structured Agency MBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Our borrowings currently consist of short-term repurchase agreements. We may use other sources of leverage, such as secured or unsecured debt or issuances of preferred stock. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of leverage we may incur. However, we generally expect that the ratio of our total liabilities compared to our equity, which we refer to as our leverage ratio, will be less than 12 to 1. Our amount of leverage may vary depending on market conditions and other factors that we deem relevant. 

We allocate our capital between two sub-portfolios. The pass-through Agency MBS portfolio will be leveraged generally through repurchase agreement funding. The structured Agency MBS portfolio generally will not be leveraged. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing our total liabilities by total stockholders&#8217; equity at the end of each period. The amount of leverage will be a function of the capital allocated to the pass-through Agency MBS portfolio and the amount of haircuts required by our lenders on our borrowings. When the capital allocation to the pass-through Agency MBS portfolio is high, the leverage ratio will be high since more capital is being explicitly leveraged and less capital is un-leveraged. If the haircuts required by our lenders on our borrowings are higher, all else being equal, our leverage will be lower since our lenders will lend less against the value of the capital deployed to the pass-through Agency MBS portfolio. The allocation of capital between the two portfolios will be a function of several factors: 

&#183; 

The relative durations of the respective portfolios &#8212; We generally seek to have a combined duration at or near zero. If our pass-through securities have a longer duration, we will allocate more capital to the structured security portfolio to achieve a combined duration close to zero. 

&#183; 

The relative attractiveness of pass-through securities versus structured securities &#8212; To the extent we believe the expected returns of one type of security are higher than the other, we will allocate more capital to the more attractive securities, subject to the caveat that its combined duration remains at or near zero. 

&#183; 

Liquidity &#8212; We seek to maintain adequate cash and unencumbered securities relative to our repurchase agreement borrowings well in excess of anticipated price or prepayment related margin calls from our lenders. To the extent we feel price or prepayment related margin calls will be higher/lower, we will allocate less/more capital to the pass-through Agency MBS portfolio. Our pass-through Agency MBS portfolio likely will be our only source of price or prepayment related margin calls because we generally will not apply leverage to our structured Agency MBS portfolio. From time to time we may pledge a portion of our structured securities and retain the cash derived so it can be used to enhance our liquidity. 

Risk Management 

We invest in Agency MBS to mitigate credit risk. Additionally, our Agency MBS are backed by a diversified base of mortgage loans to mitigate geographic, loan originator and other types of concentration risks. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

We believe that the risk of adverse interest rate movements represents the most significant risk to the value of our portfolio. This risk arises because (i) the interest rate indices used to calculate the interest rates on the mortgages underlying our assets may be different from the interest rate indices used to calculate the interest rates on the related borrowings, and (ii) interest rate movements affecting our borrowings may not be reasonably correlated with interest rate movements affecting our assets. We attempt to mitigate our interest rate risk by using the techniques described below: 

Agency MBS Backed by ARMs . We seek to minimize the differences between interest rate indices and interest rate adjustment periods of our Agency MBS backed by ARMs and related borrowings. At the time of funding, we typically align (i) the underlying interest rate index used to calculate interest rates for our Agency MBS backed by ARMs and the related borrowings and (ii) the interest rate adjustment periods for our Agency MBS backed by ARMs and the interest rate adjustment periods for our related borrowings. As our borrowings mature or are renewed, we may adjust the index used to calculate interest expense, the duration of the reset periods and the maturities of our borrowings. 

Agency MBS Backed by Fixed-Rate Mortgages . As interest rates rise, our borrowing costs increase; however, the income on our Agency MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages remains unchanged. We may seek to limit increases to our borrowing costs through the use of interest rate swap or cap agreements, options, put or call agreements, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments to effectively convert our floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings. 

Agency MBS Backed by Hybrid ARMs . During the fixed-rate period of our Agency MBS backed by hybrid ARMs, the security is similar to Agency MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages. During this period, we may employ the same hedging strategy that we employ for our Agency MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages. Once our Agency MBS backed by hybrid ARMs convert to floating rate securities, we may employ the same hedging strategy as we employ for our Agency MBS backed by ARMs. 

Derivative Instruments. We enter into derivative instruments to economically hedge against the possibility that rising rates may adversely impact the value of our repurchase agreement liabilities. The principal instruments that the Company has used to date are Eurodollar and Treasury Note (&#8220;T-Note&#8221;) futures contracts and options to enter into interest rate swaps (&#8220;interest rate swaptions&#8221;), but may enter into other transactions in the future. 

Interest rate swaptions provide us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount, stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future. We may enter into swaption agreements that provide us the option to enter into a pay fixed rate interest rate swap ("payer swaption"), or swaption agreements that provide us the option to enter into a receive fixed interest rate swap ("receiver swaptions"). 

Additionally, our structured Agency MBS generally exhibit sensitivities to movements in interest rates different than our pass-through Agency MBS. To the extent they do so, our structured Agency MBS may protect us against declines in the market value of our combined portfolio that result from adverse interest rate movements, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case. 

We may purchase a portion of our Agency RMBS through forward settling transactions, including &#8220;to-be-announced&#8221; (&#8220;TBA&#8221;) securities transactions. We account for TBA securities as derivative instruments if either the TBA securities do not settle in the shortest period of time possible or if we cannot assert that it is probable at the inception of the TBA transaction, and throughout its term, that we will take physical delivery of the Agency RMBS for a long position, or make delivery of the Agency RMBS for a short position, upon settlement of the trade. However, we have not entered into these TBA securities transactions as a hedge of our interest rate risk. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Prepayment Risk Management 

The risk of mortgage prepayments is another significant risk to our portfolio. When prevailing interest rates fall below the coupon rate of a mortgage, mortgage prepayments are likely to increase. Conversely, when prevailing interest rates increase above the coupon rate of a mortgage, mortgage prepayments are likely to decrease. 

When prepayment rates increase, we may not be able to reinvest the money received from prepayments at yields comparable to those of the securities prepaid. Also, some ARMs and hybrid ARMs which back our Agency MBS may bear initial &#8220;teaser&#8221; interest rates that are lower than their fully-indexed interest rates. If these mortgages are prepaid during this &#8220;teaser&#8221; period, we may lose the opportunity to receive interest payments at the higher, fully-indexed rate over the expected life of the security. Additionally, some of our structured Agency MBS, such as IOs and IIOs, may be negatively affected by an increase in prepayment rates because their value is wholly contingent on the underlying mortgage loans having an outstanding principal balance. 

A decrease in prepayment rates may also have an adverse effect on our portfolio. For example, if we invest in POs, the purchase price of such securities will be based, in part, on an assumed level of prepayments on the underlying mortgage loan. Because the returns on POs decrease the longer it takes the principal payments on the underlying loans to be paid, a decrease in prepayment rates could decrease our returns on these securities. 

Prepayment risk also affects our hedging activities . When an Agency MBS backed by a fixed-rate mortgage or hybrid ARM is acquired with borrowings, we may cap or fix our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed-rate portion of the related Agency MBS. If prepayment rates are different than our projections, the term of the related hedging instrument may not match the fixed-rate portion of the security, which could cause us to incur losses. 

Because our business may be adversely affected if prepayment rates are different than our projections, we seek to invest in Agency MBS backed by mortgages with well-documented and predictable prepayment histories. To protect against increases in prepayment rates, we invest in Agency MBS backed by mortgages that we believe are less likely to be prepaid. For example, we invest in Agency MBS backed by mortgages (i) with loan balances low enough such that a borrower would likely have little incentive to refinance, (ii) extended to borrowers with credit histories weak enough to not be eligible to refinance their mortgage loans, (iii) that are newly originated fixed-rate or hybrid ARMs or (iv) that have interest rates low enough such that a borrower would likely have little incentive to refinance. To protect against decreases in prepayment rates, we may also invest in Agency MBS backed by mortgages with characteristics opposite to those described above, which would typically be more likely to be refinanced. We may also invest in certain types of structured Agency MBS as a means of mitigating our portfolio-wide prepayment risks. For example, certain tranches of CMOs are less sensitive to increases in prepayment rates, and we may invest in those tranches as a means of hedging against increases in prepayment rates. 

Liquidity Management Strategy 

Because of our use of leverage, we manage liquidity to meet our lenders&#8217; margin calls by maintaining cash balances or unencumbered assets well in excess of anticipated margin calls; and making margin calls on our lenders when we have an excess of collateral pledged against our borrowings. 

We also attempt to minimize the number of margin calls we receive by: 

&#183; 

Deploying capital from our leveraged Agency MBS portfolio to our unleveraged Agency MBS portfolio; 

&#183; 

Investing in Agency MBS backed by mortgages that we believe are less likely to be prepaid to decrease the risk of excessive margin calls when monthly prepayments are announced. Prepayments are declared, and the market value of the related security declines, before the receipt of the related cash flows. Prepayment declarations give rise to a temporary collateral deficiency and generally result in margin calls by lenders; 

&#183; 

Obtaining funding arrangements which defer or waive prepayment-related margin requirements in exchange for payments to the lender tied to the dollar amount of the collateral deficiency and a predetermined interest rate; and 

&#183; 

Reducing our overall amount of leverage. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

To the extent we are unable to adequately manage our interest rate exposure and are subjected to substantial margin calls, we may be forced to sell assets at an inopportune time which in turn could impair our liquidity and reduce our borrowing capacity and book value. 

Management of Orchid 

Upon completion of its initial public offering, Orchid became externally managed and advised by Bimini Advisors and its MBS investment team pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. As Manager, Bimini Advisors is responsible for administering Orchid&#8217;s business activities and day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, Bimini Advisors provides Orchid with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel. Bimini Advisors is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of Orchid&#8217;s board of directors, of which a majority of the members are independent, and is only permitted to perform such functions delegated by Orchid&#8217;s Board. Bimini Advisors&#8217; authority to act on behalf of Orchid is at all times limited by the oversight of the Orchid board of directors and has only such functions and authority as delegated to it. 

Bimini Advisors receives a monthly management fee in the amount of: 

&#183; 

One-twelfth of 1.5% of the first $250 million of the Orchid&#8217;s equity, as defined in the management agreement, 

&#183; 

One-twelfth of 1.25% of the Orchid&#8217;s equity that is greater than $250 million and less than or equal to $500 million, and 

&#183; 

One-twelfth of 1.00% of the Orchid&#8217;s equity that is greater than $500 million. 

Orchid is obligated to reimburse Bimini Advisors for any direct expenses incurred on its behalf. In addition, Bimini Advisors began allocating to Orchid its pro rata portion of certain overhead costs set forth in the management agreement commencing with the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2014. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it shall pay to Bimini Advisors a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the initial term or automatic renewal term. 

Tax Status 

As a REIT from inception through December 31, 2014, Bimini Capital was not subject to corporate income tax to the extent we currently distributed our taxable income to our shareholders, and complied with other Code requirements for REITs. However, Bimini Capital&#8217;s subsidiaries, which were TRSs through December 31, 2014, were subject to corporate income tax on their income. Bimini Capital and its subsidiaries have NOL carryforwards that, subject to various expiration dates, are available to offset any 2015 or future taxable income. See Note 13, Income Taxes. 

Bimini Capital&#8217;s status as a REIT terminated effective as of January 1, 2015. The failure to qualify as a REIT subjects Bimini Capital&#8217;s taxable income to federal and state corporate income taxes at regular corporate rates. However, we believe the NOL carryforwards of Bimini Capital and its subsidiaries will be available to offset taxable income, if any, in 2015 and in future periods. Because the REIT-based ownership restrictions in Bimini Capital&#8217;s articles of incorporation no longer apply, Bimini Capital may be more likely to experience an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; under Code Sections 382 and 383, which could severely limit its ability to utilize the remaining NOL carry-forwards against future taxable income. Management is implementing certain internal restructuring transactions that would maximize its ability to utilize the existing federal NOL carryforwards. Also, Bimini Capital is prohibited from again electing to be taxed as a REIT until 2020. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition, the loss of Bimini Capital&#8217;s REIT status eliminates the income, asset, distribution, and stock ownership requirements applicable to REITs, which will provide the Company with more flexibility in executing its business strategy. Specifically, because Bimini Capital is no longer required to derive a significant portion of its income from mortgage or other real estate related investments, the Company will have greater flexibility to invest in other types of assets as part of its investing strategy, subject to maintaining compliance with its exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, because Bimini Capital will no longer be subject to the REIT distribution requirement, the Company will have greater flexibility to retain earnings to fund future growth. 

Investment Company Act Exemption 

We operate our business so that we are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. We rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which applies to companies in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on, and interests in, real estate. In order to rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), we must maintain at least 55% of our assets in qualifying real estate assets. For the purposes of this test, structured Agency MBS are non-qualifying real estate assets. We monitor our portfolio periodically and prior to each investment to confirm that we continue to qualify for the exemption. To qualify for the exemption, we make investments so that at least 55% of the assets we own consist of qualifying mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, which we refer to as qualifying real estate assets, and so that at least 80% of the assets we own consist of real estate-related assets, including our qualifying real estate assets. 

We treat whole-pool pass-through Agency MBS as qualifying real estate assets based on no-action letters issued by the staff of the SEC. In August 2011, the SEC, through a concept release, requested comments on interpretations of Section 3(c)(5)(C). To the extent that the SEC or its staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may fail to qualify for this exemption. We manage our pass-through Agency MBS portfolio such that we have sufficient whole-pool pass-through Agency MBS to ensure we maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. At present, we generally do not expect that our investments in structured Agency MBS will constitute qualifying real estate assets but will constitute real estate-related assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 7 full-time employees. 

Competition 

Our net income largely depends on our ability to acquire Agency MBS at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. When we invest in Agency MBS and other investment assets, we compete with a variety of institutional investors, including mortgage REITs, insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, investment banking firms, banks and other financial institutions that invest in the same types of assets, the Federal Reserve Bank and other governmental entities or government sponsored entities. Many of these investors have greater financial resources and access to lower costs of capital than we do. The existence of these competitive entities, as well as the possibility of additional entities forming in the future, may increase the competition for the acquisition of mortgage related securities, resulting in higher prices and lower yields on assets.
