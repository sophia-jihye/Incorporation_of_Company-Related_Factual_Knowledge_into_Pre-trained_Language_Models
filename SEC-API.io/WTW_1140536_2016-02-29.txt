Willis Towers Watson plc 

General 

Willis Towers Watson is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. As of the date of this report, Willis Towers Watson has approximately 39,000 employees in more than 120 countries. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. Our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance. 

We bring together professionals from around the world - experts in their areas of specialty - to deliver the perspectives that give organizations a clear path forward. We do this by offering risk management, insurance broking, consulting, technology and solutions and private exchanges. 

In our capacity as risk advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account. 

In our capacity as a group employee benefits advisor, we provide multiple options on a global basis for large national, regional and global clients to meet their needs for consistency across jurisdictions. Through our group exchanges, unique arrangements with global and regional carriers and individual client assignments, Health &#38; Benefits brings a deep understanding of client priorities, issues, challenges and opportunities to every client assignment and takes a balanced approach to four key drivers: Financial/Cost Management, Employee Appreciation, Resource Management and Global Governance and Oversight. 

In our capacity as a consultant, technology and solutions and private exchange company we help our clients enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. We focus on delivering consulting services that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals. We operate the largest private Medicare exchange in the United States. Through this exchange, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with retiree healthcare benefits. 

We derive the majority of our revenue from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenues for any of our three most recent fiscal years. 

We and our colleagues serve a diverse base of clients ranging in size from large, major multinational corporations to middle-market companies in a variety of industries, public institutions, and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We work with major corporations, emerging growth companies, governmental agencies and not-for-profit institutions in a wide variety of industries. 

We believe we are one of only a few global advisory, broking and solutions companies in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet effectively the global needs of many of our clients. 

Business Strategy 

Willis Towers Watson sees that a unified approach to people and risk can be a path to growth for our clients. Our integrated teams bring together our understanding of risk strategies, and market analytics. This helps clients around the world to achieve their objectives. 

We operate in attractive markets - both growing and mature - with a diversified platform across geographies, industries, segments and lines of business. We aim to create and become the premier advisory, broking and solutions company of choice globally. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital 

About Willis Towers Watson 

to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We will also help organizations improve performance through effective people, risk and financial management by focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services. 

We believe we can achieve this by: 

&#8226; 

Delivering a powerful client proposition with an integrated global platform. Our highly complementary offerings provide comprehensive advice, analytics, specialty capabilities and solutions covering benefits, exchange solutions, brokerage and advisory, risk and capital management; and talent and rewards; 

&#8226; 

Leveraging our combined distribution strength and global footprint to enhance market penetration and provide a platform for further innovation; and 

&#8226; 

Underpinning this growth through continuous operational improvement initiatives that help make us more effective and efficient and drive cost synergies. We do this by: 

&#9702; 

continuing to modernize the way we run our business to better serve our clients, enable the skills of our staff, and lowering our costs of doing business; we do this through an operational improvement program that is making changes to our processes, our IT, our real estate and our workforce location; and 

&#9702; 

targeting and delivering identified, highly achievable cost savings as a direct consequence of the merger of Willis and Towers Watson. 

We care as much about how we work as we do about the impact that we make. This means commitment to our aligned cultures and shared values and behaviors of our legacy companies, a framework that guides how we run our business and serve clients. 

Through these strategies we aim to accelerate revenue, cash flow, EBITDA and earnings growth and generate compelling returns for investors, by delivering tangible revenue growth and capitalizing on the identified cost synergies. 

Our Business 

We are integrating Willis and Towers Watson (together, the &#8216;Legacy Companies&#8217;) and creating a unified platform for global growth, including positioning the Company to leverage our mutual distribution strength to enhance market penetration, expand our global footprint and create a strong platform for further innovation. The fully integrated Company will have a more comprehensive offering of services and solutions to provide to clients across four business segments: Corporate Risk and Broking; Exchange Solutions; Human Capital and Benefits; and Investment, Risk and Reinsurance. 

Due to the closing date of the Merger on January 4, 2016, after the end of the fiscal year, Legacy Towers Watson results of operations and financial position are not presented in this Form 10-K. The descriptions of the combined company segments are presented to assist the reader in understanding our ongoing integrated company. Please see Note 31 &#8212; Subsequent Events for additional information. 

Management Structure 

Until we are integrated, we will continue to manage our business through the Legacy Company platforms. Legacy Willis has four reportable operating segments: Willis CWR; Willis GB; Willis North America; and Willis International. Legacy Towers Watson has four reportable operating segments: Benefits; Exchange Solutions; Risk and Financial Services; and Talent and Rewards. From April 1, 2016, we expect to manage our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Corporate Risk and Broking; Exchange Solutions; Human Capital and Benefits; and Investment, Risk and Reinsurance.

The Towers Watson Risk and Financial Services (&#8216;RFS&#8217;) segment includes two lines of business:

Risk Consulting and Software 

&#8226; 

Investment 

We work with chief financial officers, treasurers, chief risk officers, senior actuaries, pension plan sponsors and trustees of our clients&#8217; organizations.

The two lines of business also apply their expertise to serve broader markets. 

Risk Consulting and Software 

Our Risk Consulting and Software line of business serves the insurance industry as well as corporate clients with respect to their insurance and risk management needs. Our colleagues use strong analytical skills, proven consulting techniques and software solutions to help our clients improve business performance.

We provide coordinated investment advice and solutions - based on our expertise in risk assessment, asset-liability modeling, strategic asset allocation policy setting, manager selection and investment execution - to some of the world&#8217;s largest pension funds and institutional investors. 

Towers Watson Talent and Rewards Segment 

The Towers Watson Talent and Rewards segment includes three lines of business: 

&#8226; 

Executive Compensation 

&#8226; 

Rewards, Talent and Communication 

&#8226; 

Data, Surveys and Technology 

Willis Towers Watson plc 

Executive Compensation 

We advise our clients&#8217; management and boards of directors on all aspects of executive pay programs, including base pay, annual bonuses, long-term incentives, perquisites and other benefits. We help clients understand market practices in these areas. Given that companies in all world regions face scrutiny of executive pay from shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders, our focus is on aligning pay plans with the organization&#8217;s business strategy and driving desired performance. Our services include executive compensation philosophy and strategy development, modeling and valuation of pay plan elements, performance measurement selection and calibration, board of director compensation and plan design, advice on change-in-control and severance programs, and total compensation assessment and benchmarking. 

Rewards, Talent and Communication 

This line of business offers a broad array of advisory services focused on designing and implementing Rewards and Talent Management programs and processes. Our solutions help companies attract and deploy talent, engage them over time, manage and reward their performance, develop their skills, provide them with relevant career paths, communicate with them and manage organizational change initiatives. 

Data, Surveys and Technology 

This line of business provides benchmarking data, employee surveys and HR software to help companies administer and manage their talent management and reward programs. 

Clients 

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from large, major multinational corporations to middle-market companies. We work with major corporations, emerging growth companies, governmental agencies and not-for-profit institutions in a wide variety of industries. Further, many of our client relationships span decades. For instance, our relationship with The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for a significant concentration of revenues for fiscal year 2015 . Additionally, we place insurance with approximately 2,500 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for a significant concentration of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2015 . 

Competition 

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh &#38; McLennan and Aon, the two other major providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and in some business lines Marsh &#38; McLennan and Aon have greater market share than we do. The global HR consulting industry includes other benefit and compensation firms and the human resource consulting divisions of diversified professional service firms, including Deloitte Consulting LLP, Accenture, Ernst &#38; Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 

Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services. 

The human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive. We believe there are significant barriers to entry, and we have developed competitive advantages in providing HR consulting and risk management consulting services. We face strong competition from several sources. 

Our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are Mercer HR Consulting (a Marsh &#38; McLennan company) and Aon Hewitt Consulting (an Aon company). Beyond these large players, the global HR consulting industry is highly fragmented. 

Our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include Milliman, Oliver Wyman (a Marsh &#38; McLennan company), the big four accounting firms and SunGard. Aon Hewitt, Buck Consultants (a Xerox Company), Connextions (a United Healthcare company), Mercer (a Marsh &#38; McLennan company), Automatic Data Processing and 

About Willis Towers Watson 

Fidelity are our primary competitors in the insurance exchange industry. With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we also compete with the public exchanges run by the U.S. federal and state governments. We now compete with providers of account-based health plans and consumer-directed benefits such as WageWorks and HealthEquity. 

The market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. Regulatory and legislative actions, along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources consulting or risk management services firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients&#8217; unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution, a provider&#8217;s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options, and an innovative service delivery model and platform. For our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products, we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. 

Regulation 

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in all countries in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria. Our three most significant regulatory regions are described below: 

United States 

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states. 

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities. Our activities in connection with investment services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision at both the federal and state levels. At the federal level, certain of our operating subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC through the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers&#8217; Act of 1940; and by the Department of Labor through the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. In connection with the SEC regulation, we are required to file certain reports, and are subject to various marketing restrictions, among other regulations. In connection with the ERISA regulation, we are restricted in actions we can take for plans for whom we serve as fiduciaries, among other matters. Our U.S. investment activities are also subject to certain state regulatory schemes. 

Our Willis Capital Markets &#38; Advisory business (&#8216;Willis Capital Markets&#8217;) operates through our two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Willis Securities, Inc., a US-registered broker-dealer and member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions, and Westport HRH LLC. 

Our activities in connection with Third Party Administrator (&#8216;TPA&#8217;) services in the United States are also subject to regulation and supervision by many state authorities. Licensing requirements and supervision vary from state to state. As with insurance brokerage services, our continuing ability to provide these services in states that regulate our activities are dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states. 

European Union 

In 2005, the European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the European Union on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that
