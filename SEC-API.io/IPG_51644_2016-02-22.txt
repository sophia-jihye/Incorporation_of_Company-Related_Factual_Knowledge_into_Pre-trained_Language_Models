Business 

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (&#8220;Interpublic,&#8221; the "Company," &#8220;IPG,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by Harrison K. McCann. The Company has operated under the Interpublic name since January 1961. 

About Us 

We are one of the world&#8217;s premier global advertising and marketing services companies. Through our 49,200 &#32;employees in all major world markets, our companies specialize in consumer advertising, digital marketing, communications planning and media buying, public relations and specialized communications disciplines. Our agencies create customized marketing programs for clients that range in scale from large global marketers to regional and local clients. Comprehensive global services are critical to effectively serve our multinational and local clients in markets throughout the world as they seek to build brands, increase sales of their products and services, and gain market share. 

The work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs. Our solutions vary from project-based activity involving one agency to long-term, fully integrated campaigns created by multiple IPG agencies working together. With offices in over 100 &#32;countries, we can operate in a single region or deliver global integrated programs. 

The role of our holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet clients&#8217; needs. Based in New York City, our holding company sets company-wide financial objectives and corporate strategy, establishes financial management and operational controls, guides personnel policy, directs collaborative inter-agency programs, conducts investor relations, manages corporate social responsibility programs, provides enterprise risk management and oversees mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we provide certain centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies, including accounting and finance, executive compensation management and recruitment assistance, employee benefits, marketing information retrieval and analysis, internal audit, legal services, real estate expertise and travel services. 

Our Brands 

Interpublic is home to some of the world&#8217;s best-known and most innovative communications specialists. We have three global networks: McCann Worldgroup, Foote, Cone &#38; Belding ("FCB") and MullenLowe Group, which provide integrated, large-scale advertising and marketing solutions for clients. Our global media services companies include UM and Initiative, which operate under the IPG Mediabrands umbrella. We also have a range of best-in-class global specialized communications assets as well as premier domestic integrated and digital agencies that are industry leaders. 

&#8226;

Market Strategy 

We operate in a media landscape that continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Media channels continue to fragment, and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment. To stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives, we have made and continue to make investments in creative and strategic talent in areas including fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth geographic regions and strategic world markets. We consistently review opportunities within our Company to enhance our operations through mergers and strategic alliances, as well as the development of internal programs that encourage intra-company collaboration. As appropriate, we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leading-edge marketing tools that complement our agencies' skill sets and capabilities. 

In recent years, we have taken several major strategic steps to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market. These include: 

&#8226; 

Investment in senior talent: &#32;We successfully completed management succession at our media management company, one of our global advertising networks and at a number of our U.S. integrated agencies and leading marketing services firms. We continue to acquire and develop top strategic, creative and digital talent. 

&#8226; 

Growing digital capabilities: &#32;&#32;Our investments in talent and technology &#8211; organically growing digital capabilities such as search, social, user experience (UX), content creation, data and analytics, and mobile across the portfolio &#8211; promise to drive further growth in this dynamic sector of our business. We continue to internationalize our powerful digital specialist agencies. 

&#8226; 

Innovative media offering: &#32;&#32;We launched IPG Mediabrands in 2007 to reinvent how we plan, buy and measure media investment for clients. Since then, it has delivered strong growth, and our Company has consistently been a leader in delivering fully competitive, efficient and effective traditional media buying to major clients, as well as automated digital ad buying and data and analytics. 

&#8226; 

Investment in emerging markets: &#32;&#32;We strengthened our position in emerging markets by driving organic growth as well as completing strategic acquisitions in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, a region in which we have led the industry in organic growth. 

&#8226; 

Integrated marketing solutions: &#32;&#32;A differentiating aspect of our business is our utilization of &#8220;open architecture&#8221; solutions that integrate the best talent from throughout the organization to fulfill the needs of our leading clients. 

Together, these steps have built a culture of strategic creativity and high performance across IPG, resulting in industry-leading new business performance, as well as increased honors and awards for our Company. In 2015, integrated media agency UM was named &#8220;Global Media Agency of the Year&#8221; by Adweek &#32;and &#8220;Media Agency of the Year&#8221; by Ad Age , two of the industry&#8217;s leading trade publications. Our best-in-class public relations offering led PRWeek &#32;to name Weber Shandwick its Global Agency of the Year in 2015 and The Holmes Report &#32;to name Weber Shandwick its &#8220;Global Agency of the Year&#8221; in 2015, 2014, 2012 and 2010. In 2015, McCann was named to the prestigious Ad Age &#32;A-List, the only global integrated creative network to receive the honor. In early 2016, Ad Age &#32;named a total of three IPG agencies, Deutsch, McCann and R/GA, to its A-List; additionally UM was named its "Media Agency of the Year." This level of industry recognition in all marketing disciplines has been consistent over the past few years and is unprecedented in our Company&#8217;s history. 

Digital Growth 

Demand for our digital marketing services continues to evolve rapidly. In order to meet this need and provide high-value resources to clients, we have focused on embedding digital talent and technology throughout the organization. This reflects our belief that digital marketing should be integrated within all of our companies. This structure mirrors the way in which consumers incorporate digital media into their other media habits and, ultimately, their daily lives. We continue to invest in recruiting and developing digital expertise at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines. 

To meet the changing needs of the marketplace, we have been active in making new acquisitions and minority investments in specialty digital assets. In addition, we have consistently invested in existing assets such as Cadreon (audience management platform), The IPG Media Lab, Huge, MRM//McCann as well as R/GA. These companies have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within IPG. 

Fast-Growth and Strategic Regions 

We continue to invest and expand our presence in high-growth and strategic geographic regions. In recent years, we have made significant investments in Brazil and India, further strengthening our leadership position in these important developing markets. Most recently, we gained a stronger foothold in Russia by acquiring three creative agencies from ADV, our longtime partner in the country. Additionally, in 2015 Golin launched GolinMagic in China, a new venture with the Magic Group to establish a new public relations agency for this key market. Our operations in India are best-in-class, and we will continue to invest in partnerships and talent in this key market. We also hold a majority stake in the Middle East Communication Networks (&#8220;MCN&#8221;), among the region's premier marketing services companies. MCN is headquartered in Dubai, with 65 offices across 14 countries. In China, where we operate with all of our global networks and across the full spectrum of marketing services, we continue to invest organically in the talent of our agency brands. Additional areas of investment include other key strategic markets in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa. 

Diversity and Inclusion 

IPG and our agencies are committed to diversity and inclusion, and we reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs. These include business resource groups that develop career building programs, as well as training around topics like unconscious bias. We seek to ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to hire, promote and retain diverse talent, and we regularly measure the inclusiveness of our culture with a company-wide climate for inclusion survey. 

We began our formal programs a decade ago. Since then, IPG has seen dramatic improvements in the diversity of our workforce. In the U.S., IPG exceeded the U.S. ad industry&#8217;s representation rates for women and minorities for both professional level and management positions in 2015. An environment that encourages respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and IPG believes a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs in its workforce. 

Acquisition Strategy 

A disciplined acquisition strategy, focused on high-growth capabilities and regions of the world, is one component of growing our services in today's rapidly-changing marketing services and media landscape. When an outstanding resource or a strong tactical fit becomes available, we have been opportunistic in making tuck-in, niche acquisitions that enhance our service offerings. We will continue to focus on digital and marketing services agencies throughout the world and on key international growth markets. 

In recent years, IPG has acquired agencies across the marketing spectrum, including firms specializing in digital, mobile marketing, social media, healthcare communications and public relations, as well as agencies with full-service capabilities. These acquired agencies have been integrated into one of our global networks or specialist agencies. In 2015, IPG&#8217;s acquisitions included a full-service digital agency in the U.K., the Russian creative agencies previously owned by ADV and a media and planning buying agency with significant digital capabilities in Canada. 

Financial Objectives 

Our financial goals include competitive organic revenue growth and operating margin expansion, which we expect will further strengthen our balance sheet and total liquidity and increase value to our shareholders. Accordingly, we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure. We continually seek greater efficiency in the delivery of our services, focusing on more effective resource utilization, including the productivity of our employees, real estate, information technology and shared services, such as finance, human resources and legal. The improvements we have made and continue to make in our financial reporting and business information systems in recent years allow us more timely and actionable insights from our global operations. Our disciplined approach to our balance sheet and liquidity provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage and grow our business. We believe that our strategy and execution position us to meet our financial goals and to deliver long-term shareholder value. 

Financial Reporting Segments 

We have two reportable segments, which are Integrated Agency Networks (&#8220;IAN&#8221;) and Constituency Management Group (&#8220;CMG&#8221;). IAN is comprised of McCann Worldgroup, FCB, MullenLowe Group, IPG Mediabrands, our digital specialist agencies and our domestic integrated agencies. CMG is comprised of a number of our specialist marketing services offerings. We also report results for the &#8220;Corporate and other&#8221; group.

Sources of Revenue 

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world. Our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated, and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. As is customary in the industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. 

Revenues for the creation, planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up. Many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package. This provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement. 

We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and entertainment marketing, and corporate and brand identity services. 

In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients, as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries. To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients, and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges . Generally, we act as the client&#8217;s agent rather than the primary obligor. 

Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work that is typically completed during the fourth quarter. Fee revenue recognized on a completed-contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at December 31.

Clients 

Our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world. Our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors. In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 19% &#32;and 20% &#32;of revenue in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Our largest client accounted for approximately 4% &#32;and 5% &#32;of revenue for 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 , our largest client sectors (in alphabetical order) were auto and transportation, healthcare and tech and telecom. We represent several different clients, brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets, as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines, in each case through more than one of our agency brands. Representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations. Any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency, and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time. 

We operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry. Our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships. 

Personnel 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 49,200 &#32;people, of whom approximately 19,900 &#32;were employed in the United States. Because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business, the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success. We conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention. There is keen competition for qualified employees.
