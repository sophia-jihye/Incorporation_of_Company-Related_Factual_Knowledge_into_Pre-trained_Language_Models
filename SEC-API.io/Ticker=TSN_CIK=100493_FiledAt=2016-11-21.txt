 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Founded in 1935, Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is one of the world's largest food companies with leading brands such as Tyson&#174;, Jimmy Dean&#174;, Hillshire Farm&#174;, Sara Lee&#174;, Ball Park&#174;, Wright&#174;, Aidells&#174; and State Fair&#174;. We are a recognized market leader in chicken, beef and pork as well as prepared foods, including bacon, breakfast sausage, turkey, lunchmeat, hot dogs, pizza crusts and toppings, tortillas and desserts. Our operations are conducted in four reportable segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs, raw materials, grain and feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities. 

We operate a fully vertically integrated chicken production process. Our integrated operations consist of breeding stock, contract growers, feed production, processing, further-processing, marketing and transportation of chicken and related allied products, including animal and pet food ingredients. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cobb-Vantress, Inc., we are one of the leading poultry breeding stock suppliers in the world. Investing in breeding stock research and development allows us to breed into our flocks the characteristics found to be most desirable. 

We also process live fed cattle and hogs and fabricate dressed beef and pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts, case ready beef and pork and fully-cooked meats. In addition, we derive value from allied products such as hides and variety meats sold to further processors and others. 

We produce a wide range of fresh, value-added, frozen and refrigerated food products. Our products are marketed and sold primarily by our sales staff to grocery retailers, grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, warehouse club stores, military commissaries, industrial food processing companies, chain restaurants or their distributors, live markets, international export companies and domestic distributors who serve restaurants, foodservice operations such as plant and school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors. Additionally, sales to the military and a portion of sales to international markets are made through independent brokers and trading companies. 

On August 28, 2014, we acquired and consolidated The Hillshire Brands Company ("Hillshire Brands"), a manufacturer and marketer of branded, convenient foods. Hillshire Brands' results of operations are included in the Prepared Foods segment. For further description of this transaction, refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3: Acquisitions and Dispositions. 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SEGMENTS 

We operate in four reportable segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods.

RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY 

Chicken: &#32;The primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers. Our vertically-integrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing. Breeder flocks (i.e., grandparents) are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced. Fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets (i.e., parents). Pullets are sent to breeder houses, and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries. Once chicks have hatched, they are sent to broiler farms. There, contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards, with advice from our technical service personnel, until the broilers reach the desired processing weight. Adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are slaughtered and converted into finished products, which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers. 

We operate feed mills to produce scientifically-formulated feeds. In fiscal 2016 , corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs, representing roughly 57% &#32;of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically. In addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens, we use cooking ingredients, packaging materials and cryogenic agents. We believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs, and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future. While we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers, we also purchase ice-packed or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements. 

Beef: &#32;The primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle. We do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually measure their performance. We also enter into various risk-sharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities. Although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate, there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand. 

Pork: &#32;The primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs. The majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers. We employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are processed. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually measure their performance. We believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs. Additionally, we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs. 

Prepared Foods: &#32;The primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials, including chicken, beef, pork, turkey, corn, flour, vegetables and other cooking ingredients. Some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments, while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers. We believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs. 

SEASONAL DEMAND 

Demand for chicken, beef, and certain prepared foods products, such as hot dogs and smoked sausage, generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months. Pork and certain other prepared foods products, such as prepared meals, meat dishes, appetizers, frozen pies and breakfast sausage, generally experience increased demand during the winter months, primarily due to the holiday season, while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months. 

CUSTOMERS 

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for 17.5% &#32;of our fiscal 2016 &#32;consolidated sales. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were included in all of our segments. Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a material impact on our operations. No other single customer or customer group represented more than 10% of fiscal 2016 &#32;consolidated sales. 

COMPETITION 

Our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers. Additionally, our food products compete in markets around the world. 

We seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy, which includes: 

&#8226; 

identifying target markets for value-added products; 

&#8226; 

concentrating production, sales and marketing efforts to appeal to and enhance demand from those markets; and 

&#8226; 

utilizing our national distribution systems and customer support services. 

Past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy, as supported by our distribution systems. The principal competitive elements are price, product safety and quality, brand identification, innovation, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of products, customer service and credit terms. 

FOREIGN OPERATIONS 

We sold products in approximately 115 &#32;countries in fiscal 2016 . Major sales markets include Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, South Korea and Taiwan. 

We have the following foreign operations: 

&#8226; 

Cobb-Vantress, a chicken breeding stock subsidiary, has business interests in Argentina, Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezuela. 

&#8226; 

Tyson Rizhao, located in Rizhao, China, is a vertically-integrated chicken production operation. 

&#8226; 

Tyson Dalong, a joint venture in China in which we have a majority interest, is a chicken further-processing facility. 

&#8226; 

Tyson Nantong, located in Nantong, China, is a vertically-integrated chicken production operation. 

&#8226; 

Godrej Tyson Foods, a joint venture in India in which we have a majority interest, is primarily a chicken processing business. 

&#8226;

We continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign countries. Additional information regarding export sales and long-lived assets located in foreign countries is set forth in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16: Segment Reporting. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

We conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development, to automate manual processes in our processing plants and growout operations, and to improve chicken breeding stock. With regards to our food products we have two research and development locations, our Discovery Center in Springdale, Arkansas, and another center located in Downers Grove, Illinois. The centers include over 80,000 square feet of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) pilot plant space, two consumer sensory and focus group areas, a packaging lab and 25 research kitchens. The centers enable us to bring new market-leading retail and foodservice products to the customer quickly and efficiently. Research and development costs totaled $96 million , $75 million , and $52 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND FOOD SAFETY 

Our facilities for processing chicken, beef, pork, turkey and prepared foods, milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and except as described below, is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future. 

Congress, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and some states continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions. It is unclear at this time what options, if any, will be finalized, and whether such options would have a direct impact on the Company. Due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue, it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect. 

We work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality. In addition to our own internal Food Safety and Quality Assurance oversight and review, our chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution, primarily by the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration. We are also participants in the United States Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point program and are subject to the Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Additionally, our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review. 

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS 

As of October 1, 2016 , we employed approximately 114,000 &#32;employees. Approximately 108,000 &#32;employees were employed in the United States and 6,000 &#32;employees were employed in foreign countries, primarily in China. Approximately 29,000 &#32;employees in the United States were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, with approximately 43% &#32;of those employees at locations either under negotiation for contract renewal or included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2017 . The remaining agreements expire over the next several years. Approximately 4,000 &#32;employees in foreign countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are good. 

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

Our principal marketing objective is to be the preferred provider of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers. We build the Tyson&#174;, Jimmy Dean&#174;, Hillshire Farm&#174;, Sara Lee&#174;, Ball Park&#174;, Wright&#174;, Aidells&#174; and State Fair&#174; brands while supporting strong regional and emerging brands primarily through well-defined, product-specific advertising, marketing, and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs. We identify growth and business opportunities through consumer and customer insights derived via leading research and analytic capabilities. We utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products and brands. 

We have the ability to produce and ship fresh, frozen and refrigerated products worldwide. Domestically, our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses, public cold storage facilities and our transportation system. Our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate partial-truckload orders into full truckloads, thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service. In addition, we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders. Our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental United States. Internationally, we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports, where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations. 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 

We have filed a number of patents relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of review. Because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products, we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts and have registered and applied for the registration of a number of trademarks. We also have developed non-public proprietary information regarding our production processes and other product-related matters. We utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and, where appropriate, seek patent and/or other protection for the technology we utilize. 

INDUSTRY PRACTICES 

Our agreements with customers are generally short-term, primarily due to the nature of our products, industry practices and fluctuations in supply, demand and price for such products. In certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers, we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer, with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable.
