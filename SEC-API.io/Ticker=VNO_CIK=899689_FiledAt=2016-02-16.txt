Objectives and Strategy 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through: 

&#160; 

&#183; Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit 

&#183; Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation 

&#183; Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents 

&#183; Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area 

&#183; Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value 

&#183; &#160; Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component 

&#160; 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future. 

&#160;

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing 392,000 salable square feet on our 220 Central Park South development site. The incremental development cost of this project is approximately $1.3 billion, of which $293 million has been expended as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

We are developing The Bartlett, a 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City, which is expected to be completed in 2016. The project includes a 40,000 square foot Whole Foods Market at the base of the building. The incremental development cost of this project is approximately $250 million, of which $166 million has been expended as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

On June 24, 2015, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 55% interest, to develop a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building, located along the western edge of the High Line at 512 West 22nd Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan. The development cost of this project is approximately $235 million. On November 24, 2015, the joint venture obtained a $126 million construction loan.

&#160; 

&#160; 

SEASONALITY &#160; 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year.

&#160; 

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues

&#160; 

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long&#8209;term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

&#160;
