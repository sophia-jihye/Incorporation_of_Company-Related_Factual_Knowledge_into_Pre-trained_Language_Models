 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Westamerica Bancorporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;). Its legal headquarters are located at 1108 Fifth Avenue, San Rafael, California 94901. Principal administrative offices are located at 4550 Mangels Boulevard, Fairfield, California 94534 and its telephone number is (707) 863-6000. The Company provides a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers in Northern and Central California through its subsidiary bank, Westamerica Bank (&#8220;WAB&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The principal communities served are located in Northern and Central California, from Mendocino, Lake and Nevada Counties in the north to Kern County in the south. The Company&#8217;s strategic focus is on the banking needs of small businesses. In addition, the Bank owns 100% of the capital stock of Community Banker Services Corporation (&#8220;CBSC&#8221;), a company engaged in providing the Company and its subsidiaries with data processing services and other support functions.

&#160;

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1972 as &#8220;Independent Bankshares Corporation&#8221; pursuant to a plan of reorganization among three previously unaffiliated Northern California banks. The Company operated as a multi-bank holding company until mid-1983, at which time the then six subsidiary banks were merged into a single bank named Westamerica Bank and the name of the holding company was changed to Westamerica Bancorporation.

&#160;

The Company acquired five banks within its immediate market area during the early to mid 1990&#8217;s. In April 1997, the Company acquired ValliCorp Holdings, Inc., parent company of ValliWide Bank, the largest independent bank holding company headquartered in Central California. Under the terms of all of the merger agreements, the Company issued shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of the acquired institutions. The subsidiary banks acquired were merged with and into WAB. These six aforementioned business combinations were accounted for as poolings-of-interests.

&#160;

During the period 2000 through 2005, the Company acquired three additional banks. These acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase accounting method.

&#160;

&#160;

On February 6, 2009, Westamerica Bank acquired the banking operations of County Bank (&#8220;County&#8221;) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). On August 20, 2010, Westamerica Bank acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the former Sonoma Valley Bank (&#8220;Sonoma&#8221;) from the FDIC. The County and Sonoma acquired assets and assumed liabilities were measured at estimated fair values, as required by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had consolidated assets of approximately $5.2 billion, deposits of approximately $4.5 billion and shareholders&#8217; equity of approximately $532 million. The Company and its subsidiaries employed 813 full-time equivalent staff as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports as well as beneficial ownership reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 are available through the SEC&#8217;s website (http://www.sec.gov). Such documents as well as the Company&#8217;s director, officer and employee Code of Conduct and Ethics are also available free of charge from the Company by request to:

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

The following is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes and regulations applicable to the Company&#8217;s or the Bank&#8217;s business. The description of statutory and regulatory provisions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions. Moreover, major new legislation and other regulatory changes affecting the Company, the Bank, and the financial services industry in general have occurred in the last several years and can be expected to occur in the future. The nature, timing and impact of new and amended laws and regulations cannot be accurately predicted.

&#160;

Regulation and Supervision of Bank Holding Companies 

&#160;

The Company is a bank holding company subject to the BHCA. The Company reports to, is registered with, and may be examined by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;FRB&#8221;). The FRB also has the authority to examine the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. As such, the Company and the Bank are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the Commissioner of the California Department of Business Oversight (the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;).

&#160;

The FRB has significant supervisory and regulatory authority over the Company and its affiliates. The FRB requires the Company to maintain certain levels of capital. See &#8220;Capital Standards.&#8221; The FRB also has the authority to take enforcement action against any bank holding company that commits any unsafe or unsound practice, or violates certain laws, regulations or conditions imposed in writing by the FRB. Under the BHCA, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it acquires, merges or consolidates with any bank or bank holding company. Any company seeking to acquire, merge or consolidate with the Company also would be required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB.

&#160;

The Company is generally prohibited under the BHCA from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than banking, managing banks, or providing services to affiliates of the holding company. However, a bank holding company, with the approval of the FRB, may engage, or acquire the voting shares of companies engaged, in activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. A bank holding company must demonstrate that the benefits to the public of the proposed activity will outweigh the possible adverse effects associated with such activity.

&#160;

The FRB generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend that would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements which might adversely affect a bank holding company&#8217;s financial position. Under the FRB policy, a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. See the section entitled &#8220;Restrictions on Dividends and Other Distributions&#8221; for additional restrictions on the ability of the Company and the Bank to pay dividends.

&#160;

- 3 - 

&#160;

Transactions between the Company and the Bank are restricted under Regulation W. The regulation codifies prior interpretations of the FRB and its staff under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, subject to certain specified exemptions, a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with affiliates: (a) to an amount equal to 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate; and (b) to an amount equal to 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates. The Company is considered to be an affiliate of the Bank. A &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes, among other things, a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate, with some exceptions; and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate.

&#160;

Federal regulations governing bank holding companies and change in bank control (Regulation Y) provide for a streamlined and expedited review process for bank acquisition proposals submitted by well-run bank holding companies. These provisions of Regulation Y are subject to numerous qualifications, limitations and restrictions. In order for a bank holding company to qualify as &#8220;well-run,&#8221; both it and the insured depository institutions which it controls must meet the &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; criteria set forth in Regulation Y.

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#8220;GLBA&#8221;), or the Financial Services Act of 1999, repealed provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had prohibited commercial banks and securities firms from affiliating with each other and engaging in each other&#8217;s businesses. Thus, many of the barriers prohibiting affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms have been eliminated.

&#160;

The BHCA was also amended by the GLBA to allow new &#8220;financial holding companies&#8221; (&#8220;FHCs&#8221;) to offer banking, insurance, securities and other financial products to consumers. Specifically, the GLBA amended section 4 of the BHCA in order to provide for a framework for the engagement in new financial activities. A bank holding company (&#8220;BHC&#8221;) may elect to become an FHC if all its subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed. If these requirements are met, a BHC may file a certification to that effect with the FRB and declare that it elects to become an FHC. After the certification and declaration is filed, the FHC may engage either de novo or through an acquisition in any activity that has been determined by the FRB to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. BHCs may engage in financial activities without prior notice to the FRB if those activities qualify under the list of permissible activities in section 4(k) of the BHCA. However, notice must be given to the FRB within 30 days after an FHC has commenced one or more of the financial activities. The Company has not elected to become an FHC.

&#160;

Regulation and Supervision of Banks 

&#160;

The Bank is a California state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;), and the FRB. The regulations of these agencies affect most aspects of the Bank&#8217;s business and prescribe permissible types of loans and investments, the amount of required reserves, requirements for branch offices, the permissible scope of its activities and various other requirements.

&#160;

In addition to federal banking law, the Bank is also subject to applicable provisions of California law. Under California law, the Bank is subject to various restrictions on, and requirements regarding, its operations and administration including the maintenance of branch offices and automated teller machines, capital requirements, deposits and borrowings, shareholder rights and duties, and investment and lending activities.

&#160;

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) imposes limitations on the activities and equity investments of state chartered, federally insured banks. FDICIA also prohibits a state bank from making an investment or engaging in any activity as a principal that is not permissible for a national bank, unless the Bank is adequately capitalized and the FDIC approves the investment or activity after determining that such investment or activity does not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund.

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the "Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act" (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things:

&#160;

Centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, responsible for implementing, examining and (as to banks with $10 billion or more in assets) enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Restricted the preemption of state law by federal law and disallowed subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption. - 4 - 

&#160;

Applied the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that would apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. Required bank regulatory agencies to seek to make their capital requirements for banks countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. Changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminated the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") and increased the floor of the size of the DIF. Imposed comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself. Required large, publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management. Implemented corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders, that would apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions. Made permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance. Repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. Amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ("EFTA") to, among other things, give the FRB the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. While the Company&#8217;s assets are currently less than $10 billion, interchange fees charged by larger institutions may dictate the level of fees smaller institutions will be able to charge to remain competitive. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and implementation of new regulations and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees may increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate.

&#160;

Capital Standards 

&#160;

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions resulting in assets being recognized on the balance sheet as assets, and the extension of credit facilities such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are recorded as off balance sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 1250% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as certain securitizations. A banking organization&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off balance sheet items.

&#160;

The federal banking agencies take into consideration concentrations of credit risk and risks from nontraditional activities, as well as an institution&#8217;s ability to manage those risks, when determining the adequacy of an institution&#8217;s capital. This evaluation is made as a part of the institution&#8217;s regular safety and soundness examination. The federal banking agencies also consider interest rate risk (related to the interest rate sensitivity of an institution&#8217;s assets and liabilities, and its off balance sheet financial instruments) in the evaluation of a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s respective ratios exceeded applicable regulatory requirements. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for capital ratios of the Company and the Bank, compared to the standards for well capitalized depository institutions and for minimum capital requirements.

&#160;

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule that implements changes to the regulatory capital framework for all banking organizations over a transitional period 2015 through 2018.

&#160;

See the sections entitled &#8220;Capital Resources and Capital to Risk-Adjusted Assets&#8221; in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action and Other Enforcement Mechanisms 

&#160;

FDICIA requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios.

&#160;

An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions. In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.

&#160;

Safety and Soundness Standards 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law (&#8220;CGCL&#8221;). The CGCL provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if (i) the corporation&#8217;s retained earnings equal or exceed the amount of the proposed distribution plus unpaid accrued dividends, (if any) on securities with a dividend preference, or (ii) immediately after the dividend, the corporation&#8217;s total assets equal or exceed total liabilities plus unpaid accrued dividends (if any) on securities with a dividend preference.

&#160;

FDICIA also implemented certain specific restrictions on transactions and required federal banking regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control, loan underwriting and documentation, and asset growth. Among other things, FDICIA limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions, restricts the use of brokered deposits, limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer, director, principal shareholder or related interest, and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts. The federal banking agencies may require an institution to submit an acceptable compliance plan as well as have the flexibility to pursue other more appropriate or effective courses of action given the specific circumstances and severity of an institution&#8217;s noncompliance with one or more standards.

&#160;

Federal banking agencies require banks to maintain adequate valuation allowances for potential credit losses. The Company has an internal staff that continually reviews loan quality and reports to the Board of Directors. This analysis includes a detailed review of the classification and categorization of problem loans, assessment of the overall quality and collectability of the loan portfolio, consideration of loan loss experience, trends in problem loans, concentration of credit risk, and current economic conditions, particularly in the Bank&#8217;s market areas. Based on this analysis, Management, with the review and approval of the Board, determines the adequate level of allowance required. The allowance is allocated to different segments of the loan portfolio, but the entire allowance is available for the loan portfolio in its entirety.

&#160;

Restrictions on Dividends and Other Distributions 

&#160;

The power of the board of directors of an insured depository institution to declare a cash dividend or other distribution with respect to capital is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions which limit the amount available for such distribution depending upon the earnings, financial condition and cash needs of the institution, as well as general business conditions. FDICIA prohibits insured depository institutions from paying management fees to any controlling persons or, with certain limited exceptions, making capital distributions, including dividends, if, after such transaction, the institution would be undercapitalized.

&#160;

In addition to the restrictions imposed under federal law, banks chartered under California law generally may only pay cash dividends to the extent such payments do not exceed the lesser of retained earnings of the bank or the bank&#8217;s net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders during this period). In the event a bank desires to pay cash dividends in excess of such amount, the bank may pay a cash dividend with the prior approval of the Commissioner in an amount not exceeding the greatest of the bank&#8217;s retained earnings, the bank&#8217;s net income for its last fiscal year or the bank&#8217;s net income for its current fiscal year.

&#160;

The federal banking agencies also have the authority to prohibit a depository institution from engaging in business practices which are considered to be unsafe or unsound, possibly including payment of dividends or other payments under certain circumstances even if such payments are not expressly prohibited by statute.

&#160;

- 6 - 

&#160;

Premiums for Deposit Insurance 

&#160;

Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank's capital level, asset quality and supervisory rating ("CAMELS rating").

&#160;

In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.

&#160;

In February 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule changing the deposit insurance assessment base from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, effective April 1, 2011. The FDIC also issued a final rule revising the deposit insurance assessment system for &#8220;large&#8221; institutions having more than $10 billion in assets and another for "highly complex" institutions that have over $50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over $500 billion in assets. The Bank is neither a &#8220;large&#8221; nor &#8220;highly complex&#8221; institution. Under the new assessment rules, the initial base assessment rates range from 5 to 35 basis points, and after potential adjustments for unsecured debt and brokered deposits, assessment rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points.

&#160;

The Company cannot provide any assurance as to the effect of any future changes in its deposit insurance premium rates.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Developments 

&#160;

The Bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) activities. The CRA generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. In addition to substantive penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws, the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and CRA into account when regulating and supervising other activities including merger applications.

&#160;

Financial Privacy Legislation and Customer Information Security 

&#160;

The GLBA, in addition to the previously described changes in permissible nonbanking activities permitted to banks, BHCs and FHCs, also required the federal banking agencies, among other federal regulatory agencies, to adopt regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information. The Bank is subject to the FRB&#8217;s regulations in this area. The federal bank regulatory agencies have established standards for safeguarding nonpublic personal information about customers that implement provisions of the GLBA (the &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;). Among other things, the Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

&#160;

U.S.A. PATRIOT Act 

&#160;

Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (&#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) is the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001. It includes numerous provisions for fighting international money laundering and blocking terrorist access to the U.S. financial system. The goal of Title III is to prevent the U.S. financial system and the U.S. clearing mechanisms from being used by parties suspected of terrorism, terrorist financing and money laundering. The provisions of Title III of the USA Patriot Act which affect the Bank are generally set forth as amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act. These provisions relate principally to U.S. banking organizations&#8217; relationships with foreign banks and with persons who are resident outside the United States. The USA Patriot Act does not impose any filing or reporting obligations for banking organizations, but does require certain additional due diligence and recordkeeping practices.

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160;

The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley&#8221;) are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. Sarbanes-Oxley generally applies to all companies, both U.S. and non-U.S., that file or are required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;).

&#160;

- 7 - 

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules, required the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules and mandates further studies of certain issues. Sarbanes-Oxley represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees and public company shareholders. Sarbanes-Oxley addresses, among other matters: (i) independent audit committees for reporting companies whose securities are listed on national exchanges or automated quotation systems (the &#8220;Exchanges&#8221;) and expanded duties and responsibilities for audit committees; (ii) certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; (iii) the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer&#8217;s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; (iv) a prohibition on insider trading during pension plan blackout periods; (v) disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; (vi) a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers under most circumstances with exceptions for certain normal course transactions by regulated financial institutions; (vii) expedited electronic filing requirements related to trading by insiders in an issuer&#8217;s securities on Form 4; (viii) disclosure of a code of ethics and filing a Form 8-K for a change or waiver of such code; (ix) accelerated filing of periodic reports; (x) the formation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;) to regulate public accounting firms and the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws; (xi) auditor independence; (xii) internal control evaluation and reporting; and (xiii) various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws.

&#160;

Programs To Mitigate Identity Theft 

&#160;

In November 2007, federal banking agencies together with the National Credit Union Administration and Federal Trade Commission adopted regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 to require financial institutions and other creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain new and existing accounts. Covered accounts generally include consumer accounts and other accounts that present a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft. Each institution&#8217;s program must include policies and procedures designed to: (i) identify indicators, or &#8220;red flags,&#8221; of possible risk of identity theft; (ii) detect the occurrence of red flags; (iii) respond appropriately to red flags that are detected; and (iv) ensure that the program is updated periodically as appropriate to address changing circumstances. The regulations include guidelines that each institution must consider and, to the extent appropriate, include in its program.

&#160;

Pending Legislation 

&#160;

Changes to state laws and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement) can affect the operating environment of BHCs and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced. These proposals, if codified, may change banking statutes and regulations and the Company&#8217;s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If codified, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Company cannot accurately predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur, and, if those changes occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations. It is likely, however, that the current level of enforcement and compliance-related activities of federal and state authorities will continue and potentially increase.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In the past, the Bank&#8217;s principal competitors for deposits and loans have been major banks and smaller community banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. To a lesser extent, competition was also provided by thrift and loans, mortgage brokerage companies and insurance companies. Other institutions, such as brokerage houses, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, and certain retail establishments have offered investment vehicles that also compete with banks for deposit business. Federal legislation in recent years has encouraged competition between different types of financial institutions and fostered new entrants into the financial services market.

&#160;

Legislative changes, as well as technological and economic factors, can be expected to have an ongoing impact on competitive conditions within the financial services industry. While the future impact of regulatory and legislative changes cannot be predicted with certainty, the business of banking will remain highly competitive.
