 Item 1. Business. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Founded in 1901 &#32;as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Nordstrom later incorporated in Washington state in 1946 &#32;and went on to become one of the leading fashion specialty retailers based in the U.S. As of March 14, 2016 , we operate 323 &#32;U.S. stores located in 39 &#32;states as well as a robust ecommerce business through Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook and TrunkClub.com. We also operate three &#32;Nordstrom full-line stores in Canada. The west and east coasts of the U.S. are the areas in which we have the largest presence. We have two reportable segments, which include Retail &#32;and Credit . 

As of March 14, 2016 , the Retail &#32;segment includes our 118 &#32;Nordstrom-branded full-line stores in the U.S. and Nordstrom.com, 197 &#32;off-price Nordstrom Rack stores, three &#32;Canada full-line stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, five &#32;Trunk Club clubhouses and TrunkClub.com, our two &#32;Jeffrey boutiques and one &#32;clearance store that operates under the name &#8220;Last Chance.&#8221; Through these multiple retail channels, we strive to deliver the best customer experience possible. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise focused on apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. Our integrated Nordstrom full-line stores and online store allow us to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience. In-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store&#8217;s inventory, but when inventory is unavailable at that store it may also be shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, or from other Nordstrom full-line stores. Online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our Cedar Rapids and East Coast fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom full-line stores. Our customers can also pick up online orders in our Nordstrom full-line stores if inventory is available at one of our locations. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers across various channels and improve sales. Nordstrom Rack stores purchase merchandise primarily from the same vendors carried in Nordstrom full-line stores and also serve as outlets for clearance merchandise from our Nordstrom stores and other retail channels. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook offers a persistent selection of off-price merchandise, as well as limited-time sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands and are integrated with a single customer log-in, shared shopping cart and streamlined checkout process. Nordstromrack.com combines the technology expertise of HauteLook with the merchant expertise of Nordstrom Rack. Online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our San Bernardino fulfillment center. Furthermore, we can accommodate returns from these sites by mail or at any Nordstrom Rack location. 

Through our Credit &#32;segment, our customers can access a variety of payment products and services, including a Nordstrom-branded private label card, two &#32;Nordstrom-branded Visa credit cards and a debit card for Nordstrom purchases. The credit and debit cards feature a loyalty program designed to increase customer visits and spending. Although the primary purposes of our Credit segment are to foster greater customer loyalty and drive more sales, through our program agreement with TD Bank, N.A. (&#8220;TD&#8221;) (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8), we also receive credit card revenue. In addition, we save on interchange fees that the Retail segment would incur if our customers used non-Nordstrom-branded cards. 

For more information about our business and our reportable segments, see Item 7: Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 17: Segment Reporting in Item 8. 

FISCAL YEAR 

We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. References to 2015 &#32;and all years within this document are based on a 52-week fiscal year, except 2012, which is based on a 53-week fiscal year. 

TRADEMARKS 

We have 147 &#32;trademarks, each of which is the subject of one or more trademark registrations and/or trademark applications. Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, HauteLook, Trunk Club, Halogen, BP., Zella, 14th &#38; Union, Tucker+Tate and Caslon. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely, provided that it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal. 

RETURN POLICY 

We have a fair and liberal approach to returns as part of our objective to provide high-quality customer service. We do not have a formal return policy at our Nordstrom full-line stores or online at Nordstrom.com. Our goal is to take care of our customers, which includes making returns and exchanges easy, whether in stores or online, where we offer free shipping on purchases and returns. Our Nordstrom Rack stores generally accept returns up to 90 &#32;days from the date of purchase with the original price tag and sales receipt, and also accept returns of Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook merchandise. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook generally accept returns of apparel, footwear and accessories within 90 &#32;days from the date of shipment. 

SEASONALITY 

Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Due to our Anniversary Sale in July and the holidays in the fourth quarter, our sales are typically higher in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year. In 2016, our Anniversary Sale will shift to the last week of July and the first week of August, which will move one week of event sales to the third quarter. 

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS 

We operate in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with other national, regional, local and online retailers that may carry similar lines of merchandise, including department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores, boutiques and Internet businesses. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the keys to competing in our industry are providing great customer service and customer experiences in stores and online, which includes compelling price and value, fashion newness, quality of products, selection, convenience, technology, product fulfillment, personalization and appealing, relevant store environments in top locations. 

INVENTORY 

We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to our Anniversary Sale, which has historically extended over the last two weeks of July. We also purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through December). At Nordstrom Rack we invest in pack and hold inventory which involves the strategic purchase of merchandise from some of our full-line stores&#8217; top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons to take advantage of favorable buying opportunities. This inventory is typically held for six months on average and has been an important component of Nordstrom Rack&#8217;s inventory strategy. We pay for our merchandise purchases under the terms established with our vendors. 

In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality suppliers, including domestic and foreign businesses. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. We expect our suppliers to meet our &#8220;Nordstrom Partnership Guidelines,&#8221; which address our corporate social responsibility standards for matters such as legal and regulatory compliance, labor, health and safety and the environment, and are available on our website at Nordstrom.com. 

EMPLOYEES 

During 2015 , we employed approximately 72,500 &#32;employees on a full- or part-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employment increased to approximately 74,000 &#32;employees in July 2015 &#32;and 78,000 &#32;in December 2015 . All of our employees are non-union. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
