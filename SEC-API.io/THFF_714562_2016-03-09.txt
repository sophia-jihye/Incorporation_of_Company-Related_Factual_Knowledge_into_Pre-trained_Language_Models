FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

&#160; 

A cautionary note about forward-looking statements: In its oral and written communication, First Financial Corporation from time to time includes forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements can include statements about estimated cost savings, plans and objectives for future operations and expectations about performance, as well as economic and market conditions and trends. They often can be identified by the use of words such as "expect," "may," "could," "intend," "project," "estimate," "believe" or "anticipate" or words of similar import. By their nature, forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statement. First Financial Corporation may include forward-looking statements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in other written materials such as this Annual Report and in oral statements made by senior management to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. It is intended that these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and First Financial Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the forward-looking statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

&#160; 

The discussion in Item 1A (Risk Factors) and Item 7 (Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, lists some of the factors which could cause actual results to vary materially from those in any forward-looking statements. Other uncertainties which could affect First Financial Corporation's future performance include the effects of competition, technological changes and regulatory developments; changes in fiscal, monetary and tax policies; market, economic, operational, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with First Financial Corporation's business; inflation; competition in the financial services industry; changes in general economic conditions, either nationally or regionally, resulting in, among other things, credit quality deterioration; and changes in securities markets. Investors should consider these risks, uncertainties and other factors in addition to those mentioned by First Financial Corporation in its other filings from time to time when considering any forward-looking statement. 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

First Financial Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) is a financial holding company. The Corporation was originally organized as an Indiana corporation in 1984 to operate as a bank holding company. 

&#160; 

The Corporation, which is headquartered in Terre Haute, Indiana, offers a wide variety of financial services including commercial, mortgage and consumer lending, lease financing, trust account services, depositor services and insurance services through its four subsidiaries. At the close of business in 2015 &#32;the Corporation and its subsidiaries had 896 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. 

The risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows: 

Commercial &#32; 

Commercial loans are predominately loans to expand a business or finance asset purchases. The underlying risk in the Commercial loan segment is primarily a function of the reliability and sustainability of the cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral securing the transaction. From time to time, the cash flows of borrowers may be less than historical or as planned. In addition, the underlying collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets financed or other business assets and most commercial loans are further supported by a personal guarantee. However, in some instances, short term loans are made on an unsecured basis. Agriculture production loans are typically secured by growing crops and generally secured by other assets such as farm equipment. Production loans are subject to weather and market pricing risks. The Corporation has established underwriting standards and guidelines for all commercial loan types. 

The Corporation strives to maintain a geographically diverse commercial real estate portfolio. Commercial real estate loans are primarily underwritten based upon the cash flows of the underlying real estate or from the cash flows of the business conducted at the real estate. Generally, these types of loans will be fully guaranteed by the principal owners of the real estate and loan amounts must be supported by adequate collateral value. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by factors in the local market, the regional economy, or industry specific factors. In addition, Commercial Construction loans are a specific type of commercial real estate loan which inherently carry more risk than loans for completed projects. Since these types of loans are 

underwritten utilizing estimated costs, feasibility studies, and estimated absorption rates, the underlying value of the project may change based upon the inaccuracy of these projections. Commercial construction loans are closely monitored, subject to industry standards, and disbursements are controlled during the construction process. 

Residential 

Retail real estate mortgages that are secured by 1-4 family residences are generally owner occupied and include residential real estate and residential real estate construction loans. The Corporation typically establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and generally requires private mortgage insurance if the ratio is exceeded. The Corporation sells substantially all of its long-term fixed mortgages to secondary market purchasers. Mortgages sold to secondary market purchasers are underwritten to specific guidelines. The Corporation originates some mortgages that are maintained in the bank&#8217;s loan portfolio. Portfolio loans are generally adjustable rate mortgages and are underwritten to conform to Qualified Mortgage standards. Several factors are considered in underwriting all Mortgages including the value of the underlying real estate, debt-to-income ratio and credit history of the borrower. Repayment is primarily dependent upon the personal income of the borrower and can be impacted by changes in borrower&#8217;s circumstances such as changes in employment status and changes in real estate property values. Risk is mitigated by the sale of substantially all long-term fixed rate mortgages, the underwriting of portfolio loans to Qualified Mortgage standards and the fact that mortgages are generally smaller individual amounts spread over a large number of borrowers. 

Consumer 

The consumer portfolio primarily consists of home equity loans and lines (typically secured by a subordinate lien on a 1-4 family residence), secured loans (typically secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, or motorcycles), cash/CD secured, and unsecured loans. Pricing, loan terms, and loan to value guidelines vary by product line. The underlying value of collateral dependent loans may vary based on a number of economic conditions, including fluctuations in home prices and unemployment levels. Underwriting of consumer loans is based on the individual credit profile and analysis of the debt repayment capacity for each borrower. Payments for consumer loans is typically set-up on equal monthly installments, however, future repayment may be impacted by a change in economic conditions or a change in the personal income levels of individual customers. Overall risks within the consumer portfolio are mitigated by the mix of various loan products, lending in various markets and the overall make-up of the portfolio (small loan sizes and a large number of individual borrowers). 

&#160;

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

First Financial Bank and Morris Plan face competition from other financial institutions. These competitors consist of commercial banks, a mutual savings bank and other financial institutions, including consumer finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and credit unions. 

The Corporation's business activities are centered in west-central Indiana and east-central Illinois. The Corporation has no foreign activities other than periodically investing available funds in time deposits held in foreign branches of domestic banks. 

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 

&#160; 

The Corporation and its subsidiaries operate in highly regulated environments and are subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;), and the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (the &#8220;DFI&#8221;). The laws and regulations established by these agencies are generally intended to protect depositors, not shareholders. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles may have a material effect on the Corporation&#8217;s business and prospects. The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. 

The Dodd-Frank Act &#32; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221; or &#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;), which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Although the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s provisions that have received the most public attention generally have been those applying to or more likely to affect larger institutions such as bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, it contains numerous other provisions that affect all bank holding companies and banks, including the Corporation, the Bank, and Morris Plan, some of which are described in more detail below. 

Because full implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act will occur over several years, it is difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Corporation, its customers or the financial industry generally. However, the impact is expected to be substantial and may have an adverse impact on the Corporation&#8217;s financial performance and growth opportunities. 

The Volcker Rule 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;. Although the Corporation is continuing to evaluate the impact of the Volcker Rule and the final rules adopted thereunder, the Corporation does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of the Bank, Morris Plan, or their respective subsidiaries, as the Corporation does not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. The Corporation may incur costs to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule, but any such costs are not expected to be material. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), created by the Dodd-Frank Act, is responsible for administering federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB, which began operations on July 21, 2011, is an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve and has broad rule-making, supervisory and examination authority to set and enforce rules in the consumer protection area over financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more. The CFPB also has data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that: 

(1) 

&#32;materially interfere with a consumer&#8217;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or 

(2) 

take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#8217;s: 

&#8226; 

lack of financial savvy, 

&#8226; 

inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;or 

&#8226; 

reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer&#8217;s interests. 

The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law, hold hearings and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction. 

BASEL III 

In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

The Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period) and, among other things, introduced a new capital measure known as &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), which generally consists of common equity Tier 1 capital instruments and related surplus, retained earnings, and common equity Tier 1 minority interests, minus certain adjustments and deductions. 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under the former capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Corporation, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Corporation, the Bank and Morris Plan all made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Corporation&#8217;s available-for-sale securities portfolio. The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out. The Corporation has no trust preferred securities. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specifics changes from former capital rules impacting the Corporation&#8217;s determination of risk-weighted assets include, among other things: 

&#8226; 

Applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); and 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction. 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries to maintain: 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation); 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation), and 

&#8226; 

a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 

The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2016 are as follows: 

&#8226; 

5.125% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

6.625% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

8.625% Total capital to risk-weighted assets. 

Certain regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation as of December 31, 2015, are shown below: 

&#8226; 

17.69% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

17.69% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

18.62% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

12.92% leverage ratio. 

Certain regulatory capital ratios for the Bank as of December 31, 2015, are shown below: 

&#8226; 

17.23% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

17.23% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

18.05% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

12.50% leverage ratio. 

Certain regulatory capital ratios for Morris Plan as of December 31, 2015, are shown below: 

&#8226; 

30.93% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

30.93% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

32.22% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

28.06% leverage ratio. 

The Corporation 

The Bank Holding Company Act . Because the Corporation owns all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank, it is registered as a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (&#8220;Act&#8221;) and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and required to file periodic reports of its operations and any additional information that the Federal Reserve may require. 

In general, the Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies such as the Corporation, may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 

Investments, Control, and Activities . With some limited exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring another bank holding company or acquiring more than five percent of the voting shares of a bank (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares). 

Bank holding companies are prohibited, with certain limited exceptions, from engaging in activities other than those of banking or of managing or controlling banks. They are also prohibited from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares or assets of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, other than subsidiary companies furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries, and other subsidiaries engaged in activities which the Federal Reserve 

determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be incidental to these operations. The Bank Holding Company Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of such nonbanking-related activities. 

Bank holding companies which meet certain management, capital, and Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) standards may elect to become a financial holding company, which would allow them to engage in a substantially broader range of nonbanking activities than is permitted for a bank holding company, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies. 

The Corporation is a financial holding company (&#8220;FHC&#8221;) within the meaning of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLB Act&#8221;). The GLB Act restricts the business of FHC&#8217;s to financial and related activities, and provides the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

&#160; 

it allows bank holding companies that qualify as &#8220;financial holding companies&#8221; to engage in a broad range of financial and related activities; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

&#160; 

it allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

&#160; 

it removes various restrictions that applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

&#160; 

it establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. 

As a qualified FHC, the Corporation is eligible to engage in, or acquire companies engaged in, the broader range of activities that are permitted by the GLB Act. These activities include those that are determined to be &#8220;financial in nature,&#8221; including insurance underwriting, securities underwriting and dealing, and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies. If any of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries ceases to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other things, place limitations on the Corporation&#8217;s ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require the divestiture of the banking subsidiary. In addition, if any of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the CRA, the Corporation would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries currently meet these capital, management and CRA requirements. 

Dividends . The Federal Reserve's policy is that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weakness should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which could only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company's financial health, such as by borrowing. Additionally, the Federal Reserve possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. 

Source of Strength . In accordance with Federal Reserve policy, the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and Morris Plan and to commit resources to support the Bank and Morris Plan in circumstances in which the Corporation might not otherwise do so. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. Among other requirements, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established: (i) requirements for audit committees of public companies, including independence and expertise standards; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officers and chief financial officers of reporting companies; (iii) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for reporting companies regarding various matters relating to corporate governance, and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violation of the securities laws. 

The Bank and Morris Plan 

General Regulatory Supervision . The Bank is a national bank organized under the laws of the United States of America and is subject to the supervision of the OCC, whose examiners conduct periodic examinations of the Bank. The Bank must undergo regular on-site examinations by the OCC and must submit quarterly and annual reports to the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition. 

Morris Plan is an Indiana-chartered institution and is subject to the supervision of the FDIC and the DFI, whose examiners conduct periodic examinations of Morris Plan. Morris Plan must undergo regular on-site examinations by the FDIC and the DFI and must submit quarterly and annual reports to the FDIC and the DFI concerning its activities and financial condition. 

The deposits of the Bank and Morris Plan are insured by the FDIC and are subject to the FDIC's rules and regulations respecting the insurance of deposits. See &#8220;Deposit Insurance&#8221;. 

Lending Limits . The total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower outstanding at one time and not fully secured may not exceed 15 percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus. In addition, the total amount of outstanding loans and extensions of credit to any borrower outstanding at one time and fully secured by readily marketable collateral may not exceed 10 percent of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the bank (this limitation is separate from and in addition to the above limitation). If a loan is secured by United States obligations, such as treasury bills, it is not subject to this legal lending limit. 

Deposit Insurance . The Dodd-Frank Act has permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for financial institutions per insured depositor to $250,000. 

The deposits of the Bank and Morris Plan are insured up to the applicable limits under the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is required to set a DIF reserve ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits and is required to achieve this ratio by September 30, 2020. 

In connection with the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s requirement that insurance assessments be based on assets, the FDIC bases assessments on an institution&#8217;s average consolidated assets (less average tangible equity) as opposed to its deposit level. This may shift the burden of deposit premiums toward larger depository institutions which rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk that each institution poses to the DIF. An institution&#8217;s risk to the DIF is measured by its regulatory capital levels, supervisory evaluations, and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the risk category to which it is assigned. As noted above, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC will calculate an institution&#8217;s assessment level based on its total average consolidated assets during the assessment period less average tangible equity (i.e., Tier 1 capital) as opposed to an institution&#8217;s deposit level which was the previous basis for calculating insurance assessments. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, institutions will be placed into one of four risk categories for purposes of determining the institution&#8217;s actual assessment rate. The FDIC will determine the risk category based on the institution&#8217;s capital position (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized) and supervisory condition (based on exam reports and related information provided by the institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator). The Bank paid a total FDIC assessment of $1.7 million and Morris Plan paid a total FDIC assessment of $31 thousand in 2015. 

In addition to the FDIC insurance premiums, the Bank and the Morris Plan are required to make quarterly payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds are repaid. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders . Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the Bank and Morris Plan are subject to limitations on the amount of loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates (including the Corporation) and insiders and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements. Compliance is also required with certain provisions designed to avoid the taking of low quality assets. The Bank and Morris Plan are also prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates and insiders unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. 

&#160; 

Extensions of credit by the Bank or Morris Plan to their executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests must: 

&#8226; 

be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties; and 

&#8226; 

not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also included specific changes to the law related to the definition of a &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; in Sections 23A and 23B and limitations on asset purchases from insiders. With respect to the definition of a &#8220;covered transaction,&#8221; the Dodd-Frank Act now defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for an institution&#8217;s 

loan or extension of credit to another person or company. In addition, a &#8220;derivative transaction&#8221; with an affiliate is now deemed to be a &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; to the extent that such a transaction causes an institution or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate. A separate provision of the Dodd-Frank Act states that an insured depository institution may not &#8220;purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to&#8221; a bank insider (or their related interests) unless (1) the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties and (2) if the proposed transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured institution, it has been approved in advance by a majority of the institution&#8217;s non-interested directors. 

Dividends . Applicable law provides that a financial institution, such as the Bank or Morris Plan, may pay dividends from its undivided profits in an amount declared by its Board of Directors, subject to prior regulatory approval if the proposed dividend, when added to all prior dividends declared during the current calendar year, would be greater than the current year's net income and retained earnings for the previous two calendar years. 

Federal law generally prohibits the Bank or Morris Plan from paying a dividend to the Corporation if it would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDIC may prevent a financial institution from paying dividends if it is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC. In addition, payment of dividends by a bank may be prevented by the applicable federal regulatory authority if such payment is determined, by reason of the financial condition of such bank, to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 

Community Reinvestment Act . The CRA requires that the federal banking regulators evaluate the records of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on the Bank or on Morris Plan. 

Interest Rate and Market Risk . The federal bank regulators also have issued a joint policy statement to provide guidance on sound practices for managing interest rate risk. The statement sets forth the factors the federal regulatory examiners will use to determine the adequacy of a bank's capital for interest rate risk. These qualitative factors include the adequacy and effectiveness of the bank's internal interest rate risk management process and the level of interest rate exposure. Other qualitative factors that will be considered include the size of the bank, the nature and complexity of its activities, the adequacy of its capital and earnings in relation to the bank's overall risk profile, and its earning exposure to interest rate movements. The interagency supervisory policy statement describes the responsibilities of a bank's board of directors in implementing a risk management process and the requirements of the bank's senior management in ensuring the effective management of interest rate risk. Further, the statement specifies the elements that a risk management process must contain. 

The federal banking regulators have also issued regulations revising the risk-based capital standards to include a supervisory framework for measuring market risk. The effect of these regulations is that any bank holding company or bank which has significant exposure to market risk must measure such risk using its own internal model, subject to the requirements contained in the regulations, and must maintain adequate capital to support that exposure. These regulations apply to any bank holding company or bank whose trading activity equals 10% or more of its total assets, or whose trading activity equals $1 billion or more. Examiners may require a bank holding company or bank that does not meet the applicability criteria to comply with the capital requirements if necessary for safety and soundness purposes. These regulations contain supplemental rules to determine qualifying and excess capital, calculate risk-weighted assets, calculate market risk-equivalent assets and calculate risk-based capital ratios adjusted for market risk. 

Prompt Corrective Action . The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; A depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the leverage ratio. 

A bank will be (i) &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;; (iii) &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 

3.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution&#8217;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution&#8217;s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; 

&#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well-capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. 

The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution. 

The Corporation believes that, as of December 31, 2015, the Bank and Morris Plan were each &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; based on the aforementioned ratios. 

Incentive Compensation . The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as the Corporation and the Bank, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, but the regulations have not been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which the Corporation may structure compensation for its executives. 

The Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC have issued a comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, discussed above. 

The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Corporation, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of 

incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

Ability-to-Repay Requirement and Qualified Mortgage Rule . The Dodd-Frank Act contains additional provisions that affect consumer mortgage lending. First, it significantly expands underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augments federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous new disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to encourage lenders to verify a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; Most significantly, the new standards limit the total points and fees that the Bank and/or a broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to 3% of the total loan amount. 

The CFPB has issued a final rule that implements the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s ability-to-repay requirements, and clarifies the presumption of compliance for &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; Further, the final rule also clarifies that qualified mortgages do not include &#8220;no-doc&#8221; loans and loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms in excess of 30 years, or points and fees paid by the borrower that exceed 3% of the loan amount, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, for qualified mortgages, the monthly payment must be calculated on the highest payment that will occur in the first five years of the loan, and the borrower&#8217;s total debt-to-income ratio generally may not be more than 43%. The final rule also provides that certain mortgages that satisfy the general product feature requirements for qualified mortgages and that also satisfy the underwriting requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (while they operate under federal conservatorship or receivership) or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, or Department of Agriculture or Rural Housing Service are also considered to be qualified mortgages. This second category of qualified mortgages will phase out as the aforementioned federal agencies issue their own rules regarding qualified mortgages, the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ends, and, in any event, after seven years. 

As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, subprime (or higher-priced) mortgage loans are subject to the ability-to-repay requirement, and the final rule provides for a rebuttable presumption of lender compliance for those loans. The final rule also applies the ability-to-repay requirement to prime loans, while also providing a conclusive presumption of compliance (i.e., a safe harbor) for prime loans that are also qualified mortgages. Additionally, the final rule generally prohibits prepayment penalties (subject to certain exceptions) and sets forth a 3-year record retention period with respect to documenting and demonstrating the ability-to-repay requirement and other provisions. 

USA Patriot Act . The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. Law Enforcement to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The potential impact of the USA Patriot Act on financial institutions is significant and wide-ranging. The USA Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires financial institutions to implement additional policies and procedures with respect to, or additional measures designed to address, any or all of the following matters, among others: money laundering and currency crimes, customer identification verification, cooperation among financial institutions, suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting. 

S.A.F.E. Act Requirements . Regulations issued under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 ( &#32; the &#8220;S.A.F.E. Act&#8221; ) require residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of institutions regulated by the foregoing agencies, including national banks, to meet the registration requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act. The S.A.F.E. Act requires residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of regulated financial institutions to be registered with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by the states. Employees of regulated financial institutions are generally prohibited from originating residential mortgage loans unless they are registered. 

Other Regulations 

Federal law extensively regulates other various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements. Current federal law also requires banks, among other things to make deposited funds available within specified time periods. In addition, with certain exceptions, a bank and a subsidiary may not extend credit, lease or sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for the foregoing on the condition that (i) the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from, or to, any of them, or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property or service from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of credit extended. 

Interest and other charges collected or contracted by the Bank or Morris Plan are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The loan operations are also subject to federal and state laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

&#8226; 

Truth-In-Lending Act and state consumer protection laws governing disclosures of credit terms and prohibiting certain practices with regard to consumer borrowers; 

&#8226; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#8226; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act and other fair lending laws, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#8226; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978 and Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 

&#8226; 

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

The deposit operations also are subject to the: 

&#8226; 

Customer Information Security Guidelines. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted final guidelines (the &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;) for safeguarding confidential customer information. The Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its Board of Directors, to create a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer; and implement response programs for security breaches. 

&#8226; 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E. The Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which is implemented by Regulation E, governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking service. 

&#8226; 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and the implementing regulations govern consumer financial privacy, provide disclosure requirements and restrict the sharing of certain consumer financial information with other parties. 

The federal banking agencies have established guidelines which prescribe standards for depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation fees and benefits, and management compensation. The agencies may require an institution which fails to meet the standards set forth in the guidelines to submit a compliance plan. Failure to submit an acceptable plan or adhere to an accepted plan may be grounds for further enforcement action. 

As noted above, the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has authority for amending existing consumer compliance regulations and implementing new such regulations. In addition, the Bureau has the power to examine the compliance of financial institutions with an excess of $10 billion in assets with these consumer protection rules. The Bank&#8217;s and Morris Plan&#8217;s compliance with consumer protection rules will be examined by the OCC and the FDIC, respectively, since neither the Bank nor Morris Plan meet this $10 billion asset level threshold. 

Enforcement Powers . Federal regulatory agencies may assess civil and criminal penalties against depository institutions and certain &#8220;institution-affiliated parties&#8221;, including management, employees, and agents of a financial institution, as well as independent contractors and consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution's affairs. 

In addition, regulators may commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance. Furthermore, regulators may issue cease-and-desist orders to, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the regulator to be appropriate. 

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies . The Corporation's earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Bank's monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power 

to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
