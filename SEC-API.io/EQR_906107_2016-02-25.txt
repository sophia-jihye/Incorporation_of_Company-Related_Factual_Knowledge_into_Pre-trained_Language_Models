Business Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies 

The Company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital. 

We seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation. We are focused on the six core coastal, high barrier to entry markets of Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California (including Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego), San Francisco and Seattle. These markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents: 

&#9642; 

High barriers to entry where, because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is difficult or costly to build new apartment properties, creating limits on new supply; 

&#9642; 

High home ownership costs; 

&#9642; 

Strong economic growth leading to job growth and household formation, which in turn leads to high demand for our apartments; 

&#9642; 

Urban core locations with an attractive quality of life leading to high resident demand and retention; and 

&#9642; 

Favorable demographics contributing to a larger pool of target residents with a high propensity to rent apartments. 

Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. Revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties, cost-effectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration. While we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is the customer service and superior value provided by our on-site personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends. 

We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web-based resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases, review their accounts and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on-line. 

Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt, sales of properties and joint venture agreements. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;OP Units&#8221;) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. The Company may acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future. The Company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings. 

Over the past several years, the Company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entry/non-core markets to high barrier to entry/core markets. Since 2005, the Company has sold nearly 168,000 &#32;apartment units primarily in its non-core markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately $16.6 billion , acquired over 68,000 &#32;apartment units primarily in its core markets for approximately $19.8 billion &#32;and began approximately $5.7 billion &#32;of development projects primarily in its core markets. We are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas: Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. The sale of the Starwood portfolio described below combined with the other 2016 dispositions will complete the Company's planned exit from the South Florida, Denver and Phoenix markets as well as certain New England submarkets. See further discussion below regarding the Company's 2016 disposition activity. 

As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially occupied properties and takes options on land or acquires land on which apartment properties can be constructed. We intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets. As of December 31, 2015 , no single market/metropolitan area accounted for more than 17.6% &#32;of our NOI, though NOI concentration has increased in 2016 following the sale of the Starwood portfolio. 

We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. We provide many classroom and on-line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining our properties and improvements, equipment and appliances. We actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. We monitor our employees' engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores. 

We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. Sustainability and social responsibility are key drivers of our focus on creating the best apartment communities for residents to live, work and play. We have a dedicated in-house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business, including investment activities, development, property operations and property management activities. With its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian-friendly urban locations near public transportation. When developing and renovating our 

properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting, HVAC and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption. The Company was named the 2015 Global Residential Sector Leader by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark ("GRESB") survey, a globally recognized analysis of the sustainability indicators of more than 700 real estate portfolios worldwide. For additional information regarding our sustainability efforts, see our December 2015 &#32;Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report at our website, www.equityresidential.com . For 2016, we have added an express company-wide goal regarding enhanced sustainability efforts. Employees, including our executives, will have their performance against this goal evaluated as part of our annual performance review process. 

Competition 

All of the Company's properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Company's ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Company's managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information with respect to competition. 

Starwood Transaction 

Following the approval by the Company's Board of Trustees, the Company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of Starwood Capital Group ("Starwood") on October 23, 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23,262 apartment units located in five markets across the United States for $5.365 billion (the "Starwood Transaction"). On January 26 and 27, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of all of the portfolio described above. The sale of the Starwood portfolio, combined with other planned 2016 dispositions, will result in the Company's planned exit from the South Florida, Denver and Phoenix markets as well as certain New England submarkets. The Company intends to use the majority of the proceeds from the Starwood Transaction and other planned 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of OP Units of between $10.00 and $12.00 per share/unit in the aggregate. On February 22, 2016, the Board of Trustees declared a special dividend of $8.00 per share/unit to be paid on March 10, 2016 to shareholders/unitholders of record as of March 3, 2016. The Company expects to pay an additional special dividend of approximately $2.00 to $4.00 per share/unit later in 2016. All future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the Company's Board of Trustees. The Company used and expects to use the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral. The Company has retired approximately $1.7 billion in secured and unsecured debt prior to scheduled maturity in early 2016 and expects to retire an additional $271.2 million at par at maturity in March 2016 using cash from these sales. See Notes 4, 11 and 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Archstone Transaction 

On February 27, 2013, the Company, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (&#8220;AVB&#8221;) and certain of their respective subsidiaries completed their previously announced acquisition (the "Archstone Acquisition" or the "Archstone Transaction") from Archstone Enterprise LP ("Archstone" or "Enterprise") (which subsequently changed its name to Jupiter Enterprise LP), an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (&#8220;Lehman&#8221;) and its affiliates, of all of the assets of Enterprise (including interests in various entities affiliated with Enterprise), constituting a portfolio of apartment properties and other assets (the &#8220;Archstone Portfolio&#8221;). As a result of the Archstone Acquisition, the Company owns assets representing approximately 60% of the Archstone Portfolio. The consideration paid by the Company in connection with the Archstone Acquisition consisted of cash of approximately $4.0 billion (inclusive of $2.0 billion of Archstone secured mortgage principal paid off in conjunction with the closing), 34,468,085 Common Shares (which shares had a total value of $1.9 billion based on the February 27, 2013 closing price of EQR common shares of $55.99 per share) issued to the seller and the assumption of approximately $3.1 billion of mortgage debt (inclusive of a net mark-to-market premium of $127.9 million) and approximately 60% of all of the other assets and liabilities related to the Archstone Portfolio. See Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Debt and Equity Activity 

EQR issues public equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of ERPOP. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. In addition, ERPOP issues OP Units and preference interests ("Preference Units") from time to time.
