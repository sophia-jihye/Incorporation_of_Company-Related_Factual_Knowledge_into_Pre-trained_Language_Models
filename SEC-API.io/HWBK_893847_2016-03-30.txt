General 

&#160;

The Company, Hawthorn Bancshares, Inc., is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Hawthorn Bancshares, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Missouri on October 23, 1992 as Exchange National Bancshares, Inc. and changed its name to Hawthorn Bancshares, Inc. in August 2007. The Company owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Union State Bancshares, Inc., which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Hawthorn Bank. The Company and Union State Bancshares each received approval from the Federal Reserve and elected to become a financial holding company on October 21, 2001.

&#160;

The Company acquired Hawthorn Bank and its constituent predecessor banks, as well as Union State Bancshares, in a series of transactions that are summarized as follows:

&#160;

&#183; On April 7, 1993 the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of The Exchange National Bank of Jefferson City, a national banking association, pursuant to a corporate reorganization involving an exchange of shares; &#160;

&#183; On November 3, 1997, the Company acquired Union State Bancshares, Inc., and Union's wholly-owned subsidiary, Union State Bank and Trust of Clinton; &#160;

&#183; On January 3, 2000, the Company acquired Osage Valley Bank; &#160;

&#183; Following the May 4, 2000 acquisition of Citizens State Bank of Calhoun by Union State Bank, Citizens State Bank merged into Union State Bank to form Citizens Union State Bank &#38; Trust; &#160;

&#183; On June 16, 2000, the Company acquired City National Savings Bank, FSB, which was then merged into Exchange National Bank; and &#160;

&#183; On May 2, 2005, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Bank 10, a Missouri state bank. &#160;

On December 1, 2006, the Company announced its development of a strategic plan in which, among other things, Exchange National Bank, Citizens Union State Bank, Osage Valley Bank and Bank 10 would be consolidated into a single bank under a Missouri state trust charter. This consolidation was completed in October 2007, and the subsidiary bank is now known as Hawthorn Bank.

&#160;

Except as otherwise provided herein, references herein to the &#34;Company&#34; or &#34;Hawthorn&#34; include Hawthorn Bancshares, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references herein to the &#34;Bank&#34; refers to Hawthorn Bank and its constituent predecessors.

Description of Business 

&#160; 

Company. The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act that has elected to become a financial holding company. The Company's activities currently are limited to ownership, indirectly through its subsidiary (Union State Bancshares, Inc.), of the outstanding capital stock of Hawthorn Bank. In addition to ownership of its subsidiaries, the Company may seek expansion through acquisition and may engage in those activities (such as investments in banks or operations that are financial in nature) in which it is permitted to engage under applicable law. It is not currently anticipated that the Company will engage in any business other than that directly related to its ownership of its banking subsidiary or other financial institutions.

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Union. Union State Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act that has elected to become a financial holding company. Union's activities currently are limited to ownership of the outstanding capital stock of Hawthorn Bank. It is not currently anticipated that Union will engage in any business other than that directly related to its ownership of Hawthorn Bank.

&#160; 

Hawthorn Bank . Hawthorn Bank was founded in 1932 as a Missouri bank and converted to a Missouri trust company on August 16, 1989. However, its predecessors trace their lineage back to the founding of Exchange National Bank in 1865. Hawthorn Bank has 24 banking offices, including its principal office at 132 East High Street in Jefferson City's central business district. See &#34;Item 2. Properties&#34;.

&#160;

Hawthorn Bank is a full service bank conducting a general banking and trust business, offering its customers checking and savings accounts, internet banking, debit cards, certificates of deposit, trust services, brokerage services, safety deposit boxes and a wide range of lending services, including commercial and industrial loans, single payment personal loans, installment loans and commercial and residential real estate loans.

&#160;

Hawthorn Bank's deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#34;FDIC&#34;) to the extent provided by law. Hawthorn Bank's operations are supervised and regulated by the FDIC and the Missouri Division of Finance. Periodic examinations of Hawthorn Bank are conducted by representatives of the FDIC and the Missouri Division of Finance. Such regulations, supervision and examinations are principally for the benefit of depositors, rather than for the benefit of the holders of Hawthorn Bank's common stock. See &#34;Regulation Applicable to Bank Holding Companies&#34; and &#34;Regulation Applicable to the Bank&#34;.

&#160; 

Hawthorn Real Estate . Hawthorn Real Estate, LLC, a non-bank subsidiary of the Company, was formed in December 2008 in order to purchase and hold various nonperforming assets of Hawthorn Bank. The purpose for holding these nonperforming assets in Hawthorn Real Estate is to allow for the orderly disposition of these assets and strengthen Hawthorn Bank's financial position.

&#160; 

Real Estate Holdings of Missouri, LLC . Real Estate Holdings of Missouri, LLC, a non-bank subsidiary of the Company, was formed in March 2010 in order to purchase from Hawthorn Bank and hold parcels of foreclosed real property located in and around Kansas City, Missouri. The purpose for acquiring this foreclosed real estate in Real Estate Holdings of Missouri, LLC is to allow for the orderly, and potentially more expeditious, disposition of these assets and strengthen Hawthorn Bank's financial position.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Hawthorn and its subsidiaries had approximately 313 full-time and 58 part-time employees. None of its employees is presently represented by any union or collective bargaining group, and the Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates encounter intense competition from nonbanking as well as banking sources in all of their activities. The Bank's competitors include other commercial banks, thrifts, savings banks, credit unions, and money market mutual funds. Thrifts and credit unions now have the authority to offer checking accounts and to make corporate and agricultural loans and were granted expanded investment authority by recent federal regulations. In addition, large national and multinational corporations have in recent years become increasingly visible in offering a broad range of financial services to all types of commercial and consumer customers. In the Bank's service areas, new competitors, as well as the expanding operations of existing competitors, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on the Bank's market share of deposits and loans in such service areas.

&#160;

The Bank experiences substantial competition for deposits and loans within both its primary service areas of Jefferson City, Columbia, Clinton, Lee's Summit, Warsaw, Springfield, and Branson, Missouri and its secondary service area of the nearby communities in Cole, Boone, Henry, Cass, Benton, and Greene counties of Missouri. Hawthorn Bank's principal competition for deposits and loans comes from other banks within its primary service areas and, to an increasing extent, other banks in nearby communities. Based on publicly available information, management believes that Hawthorn Bank is the third largest (in terms of deposits) of the thirteen banks within Cole county, the twelfth largest (in terms of deposits) of thirty-two banks within Boone county, the largest

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

(in terms of deposits) of the seven banks within Henry county, the fourth largest (in terms of deposits) of the seventeen banks within Cass county, and the third largest (in terms of deposits) of the five banks within Benton county. The main competition for Hawthorn Bank's trust services is from other commercial banks, including those of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

&#160; 

Regulation Applicable to Bank Holding Companies 

&#160; 

General. As a registered bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act (the &#34;BHC Act&#34;) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#34;GLB Act&#34;), Hawthorn is subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#34;FRB&#34;). The FRB has authority to issue cease and desist orders against bank holding companies if it determines that their actions represent unsafe and unsound practices or violations of law. In addition, the FRB is empowered to impose civil money penalties for violations of banking statutes and regulations. Regulation by the FRB is intended to protect depositors of the Bank, not the shareholders of Hawthorn. Hawthorn also is subject to a number of restrictions and requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 relating to internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, loans to directors or executive officers of the Hawthorn and its subsidiaries, the preparation and certification of the Hawthorn's consolidated financial statements, the duties of Hawthorn's audit committee, relations with and functions performed by Hawthorn's independent auditors, and various accounting and corporate governance matters.

&#160; 

Limitation on Activities. The activities of bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, under the GLB Act, a bank holding company, all of whose controlled depository institutions are &#34;well capitalized&#34; and &#34;well managed&#34; (as defined in federal banking regulations) with &#34;satisfactory&#34; Community Reinvestment Act ratings, may declare itself to be a &#34;financial holding company&#34; and engage in a broader range of activities. As noted above, Hawthorn is registered as a financial holding company.

&#160;

A financial holding company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. &#34;Financial in nature&#34; activities include:

&#160;

&#183; securities underwriting, dealing and market making; &#160;

&#183; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; &#160;

&#183; insurance underwriting and insurance agency activities; &#160;

&#183; merchant banking; and &#160;

&#183; activities that the FRB determines to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity or which is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a safety and soundness risk. &#160;

A financial holding company that desires to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity but not previously authorized by the FRB must obtain approval from the FRB before engaging in such activity. Also, a financial holding company may seek FRB approval to engage in an activity that is complementary to a financial activity, if it shows, among other things, that the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of its insured depository institutions or the financial system.

&#160;

A financial holding company generally may acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature without prior approval from the FRB. Prior FRB approval is required, however, before the financial holding company may acquire control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings association. In addition, under the FRB's merchant banking regulations, a financial holding company is authorized to invest in companies that engage in activities that are not financial in nature, as long as the financial holding company makes its investment with the intention of limiting the duration of the investment, does not manage the company on a day-to-day basis, and the company does not cross-market its products or services with any of the financial holding company's controlled depository institutions.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If any subsidiary bank of a financial holding company ceases to be &#34;well-capitalized&#34; or &#34;well-managed&#34; and fails to correct its condition within the time period that the FRB specifies, the FRB has authority to order the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary banks. Alternatively, the financial holding company may elect to limit its activities and the activities of its subsidiaries to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company. If any subsidiary bank of a financial holding company receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#34;CRA&#34;) of less than &#34;satisfactory&#34;, then the financial holding company is prohibited from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations until the rating is raised to &#34;satisfactory&#34; or better.

&#160; 

Limitation on Acquisitions . The BHC Act requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the FRB before:

&#160;

&#183; taking any action that causes a bank to become a controlled subsidiary of the bank holding company; &#160;

&#183; acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any bank or bank holding company, if the acquisition results in the acquiring bank holding company having control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of such bank or bank holding company, and such bank or bank holding company is not majority-owned by the acquiring bank holding company prior to the acquisition; &#160;

&#183; acquiring substantially all of the assets of a bank; or &#160;

&#183; merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. &#160; 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FRB has issued risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to United States banking organizations. If a bank holding company's capital falls below minimum required levels, then the bank holding company must implement a plan to increase its capital, and its ability to pay dividends and make acquisitions of new bank subsidiaries may be restricted or prohibited. The risk-based capital guidelines that applied to us and our subsidiary bank prior to January 1, 2015 were based on the 1988 capital accord, referred to as Basel I, of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (which we refer to as the &#34;Basel Committee&#34;), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by federal bank regulators. In 2008, the bank regulatory agencies began to phase-in capital standards based on a second capital accord issued by the Basel Committee, referred to as Basel II, for large or &#34;core&#34; international banks (generally defined for U.S. purposes as having total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more). Because we do not anticipate controlling any large or &#34;core&#34; international bank in the foreseeable future, Basel II presently does not apply to us. On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies announced new risk-based capital and leverage ratios to conform to the Basel III framework and address provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. With respect to the Company and the Bank, these requirements become effective on January 1, 2015.

&#160;

The FRB's risk-based guidelines generally define a three-tier capital framework. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital generally includes common stock instruments and related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, and, subject to certain adjustments, minority common equity interests in subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other adjustments. The rules require accumulated other comprehensive income to flow through to regulatory capital unless a one-time, irrevocable opt-out election is made. [We do not anticipate making such an opt-out election.] Banking organizations are required to deduct goodwill and other intangible assets (other than certain mortgage servicing assets), net of associated deferred tax liabilities, from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Deferred tax assets arising from temporary timing differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss (NOL) carrybacks are also deducted. Deferred tax assets that can be realized through NOL carrybacks are not deducted but are subject to 100% risk weighting. Defined benefit pension fund assets, net of any associated deferred tax liability, are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital unless the banking organization has unrestricted and unfettered access to such assets. Reciprocal cross-holdings of capital instruments in any other financial institutions are deducted from capital, not just holdings in other depository institutions. For this purpose, financial institutions are broadly defined to include securities and commodities firms, hedge and private equity funds and non-depository lenders. Banking organizations are required to deduct non-significant investments (less than 10% of outstanding stock) in the capital of other financial institutions (including investments in trust preferred securities) to the extent these exceed 10% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital subject to a 15% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital cap. Greater than 10% investments must be deducted if they exceed

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

10% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. If the aggregate amount of certain items excluded from capital deduction due to a 10% threshold exceeds 17.65% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, the excess must be deducted. The federal banking agencies did not adopt a proposed rule as part of the new regulations that would have significantly changed the risk-weighting for residential mortgages. Instead, the amended regulations continue to follow the capital rules that historically have applied to us, which assign a 50% risk-weighting to &#34;qualifying mortgage loans&#34; which generally consist of residential first mortgages with an 80% loan-to-value ratio (or which carry mortgage insurance that reduces the bank's exposure to 80%) that are not more than 90 days past due. All other mortgage loans have a 100% risk weight. The revised regulations apply a 250% risk-weighting to mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets that cannot be realized through NOL carrybacks and investments in the capital instruments of other financial institutions that are not deducted from capital. The revised regulations also create a new 150% risk-weighting category for &#34;high volatility commercial real estate loans&#34; which are credit facilities for the acquisition, construction or development of real property other than for certain community development projects, agricultural land and one- to four-family residential properties or commercial real projects where: (i) the loan-to-value ratio is not in excess of interagency real estate lending standards; and (ii) the borrower has contributed capital equal to not less than 15% of the real estate's &#34;as completed&#34; value before the loan is made.

&#160;

Tier 1 Capital generally includes Common Equity Tier 1 Capital plus Additional Tier 1 Capital elements, such as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified criteria and minority interests in subsidiaries that do not satisfy the requirements for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital treatment. Cumulative preferred stock (other than cumulative preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program or the Small Business Lending Fund) does not qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital. Trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank and savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 or by mutual holding companies may continue to be included in Tier 1 Capital but will be phased out over 10 years beginning in 2016 for all other banking organizations. These non-qualifying capital instruments, however, may be included in Tier 2 Capital. Tier 2 Capital may also include certain qualifying debt and the allowance for credit losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and other adjustments.

&#160;

The sum of the three tiers of capital less investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents the total capital. The risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital by risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities). The FRB's capital adequacy guidelines require that bank holding companies maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to at least 4.5% of its risk-weighted assets, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to at least 6% of its risk-weighted assets and a total risk-based capital ratio equal to at least 8% of its risk-weighted assets. In addition, bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%.

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, Hawthorn was in compliance with the FRB's capital adequacy guidelines. Hawthorn's capital ratios on December 31, 2015 and the minimum requirements as of that date are shown below:

&#160;

Tier I leverage Ratio (4% minimum requirement) &#160; Common Equity Tier 1 Risk- Based Capital Ratio (4.5% minimum requirement) &#160; Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio (6% minimum requirement) &#160; Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio (8%) 9.84% &#160; 9.84% &#160; 12.03% &#160; 14.78% &#160;

In addition to higher capital requirements, bank holding companies are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in over four years beginning in 2016. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis.

&#160;

Interstate Banking and Branching. Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#34;Riegle-Neal Act&#34;), a bank holding company is permitted to acquire the stock or substantially all of the assets of banks located in any state regardless of whether such transaction is prohibited under the laws of any state. The FRB will not approve an interstate acquisition if, as a result of the acquisition, the bank holding company would control more than 10% of the total amount of insured deposits in the United States or would control

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

more than 30% of the insured deposits in the home state of the acquired bank. The 30% of insured deposits state limit does not apply if the acquisition is the initial entry into a state by a bank holding company or if the home state waives such limit. The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. The Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010, a subset of the Dodd-Frank Act discussed below, permits banks to acquire and establish de novo branches in other states if a state bank in that other state would be permitted to establish the branch.

&#160;

Under the Riegle-Neal Act, individual states may restrict interstate acquisitions in two ways. A state may prohibit an out-of-state bank holding company from acquiring a bank located in the state unless the target bank has been in existence for a specified minimum period of time (not to exceed five years). A state may also establish limits on the total amount of insured deposits within the state which are controlled by a single bank holding company, provided that such deposit limit does not discriminate against out-of-state bank holding companies.

&#160; 

Source of Strength. Bank holding companies, such as the Company, are required by statute to serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary depository institutions, by providing financial assistance to their insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress. Under the source of strength requirement, the Company could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress. Furthermore, the FRB has the right to order a bank holding company to terminate any activity that the FRB believes is a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any subsidiary bank. The regulators may require these and other actions in support of controlled banks even if such action is not in the best interests of the bank holding company or its stockholders.

&#160; 

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. Under cross-guaranty provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#34;FDIA&#34;), bank subsidiaries of a bank holding company are liable for any loss incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#34;DIF&#34;), the federal deposit insurance fund for banks, in connection with the failure of any other bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

&#160; 

Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act . The Company and the Bank must comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (the &#34;BSA&#34;). The BSA was enacted to prevent banks and other financial service providers from being used as intermediaries for, or to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from, drug trafficking, money laundering, and other crimes. Since its passage, the BSA has been amended several times. These amendments include the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, which made money laundering a criminal act, as well as the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, which required regulators to develop enhanced examination procedures and increased examiner training to improve the identification of money laundering schemes in financial institutions. The USA PATRIOT Act, established in 2001, substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulations include significant penalties for non-compliance.

&#160; 

Missouri Bank Holding Company Regulation . Missouri prohibits any bank holding company from acquiring ownership or control of any bank or Missouri depository trust company that has Missouri deposits if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company would hold or control more than 13% of total Missouri deposits. Because of this restriction, among others, a bank holding company, prior to acquiring control of a bank or depository trust company that has deposits in Missouri, must receive the approval of the Missouri Division of Finance.

&#160;

Regulation Applicable to the Bank

&#160; 

General. Hawthorn Bank, a Missouri state non-member depository trust company, is subject to the regulation of the Missouri Division of Finance and the FDIC. The FDIC is empowered to issue cease and desist orders against the Bank if it determines that any activities of the Bank represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or violations of law. In addition, the FDIC has the power to impose civil money penalties for violations of banking statutes and regulations. Regulation by these agencies is designed to protect the depositors of the Bank; not shareholders of Hawthorn.

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FDIC has adopted minimum capital requirements applicable to state non-member banks, which are similar to the capital adequacy guidelines established by the FRB for bank holding companies. Federal banking laws classified an insured financial institution in one of the following five categories, depending upon the amount of its regulatory capital:

&#160;

&#183; &#34;well-capitalized&#34; if it has a total Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater (and is not subject to any order or written directive requiring the bank to adhere to a higher capital ratio); &#160;

&#183; &#34;adequately capitalized&#34; if it has a total Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater; &#160;

&#183; &#34;undercapitalized&#34; if it has a total Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 4%, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6% or a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%; &#160;

&#183; &#34;significantly undercapitalized&#34; if it has a total Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 3%, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4% or a total risk-based ratio that is less than 6%; and &#160;

&#183; &#34;critically undercapitalized&#34; if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is equal to or less than 2%. &#160;

Federal regulatory agencies are required to take prompt corrective action against undercapitalized financial institutions. On December 31, 2015, the Bank was classified as &#34;well-capitalized,&#34; which is required for Hawthorn to remain a financial holding company. The capital ratios and classifications of the Bank as of December 31, 2015 and the minimum requirements as of such date are shown on the following chart.

&#160;

Leverage Ratio (5% minimum requirement) &#160; Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio (6.5% minimum requirement) &#160; Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio (8% minimum requirement) &#160; Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio (10%) 10.73% &#160; 13.09% &#160; 13.09% &#160; 13.98% &#160; 

Limitations on Interest Rates and Loans to One Borrower. The rate of interest a bank may charge on certain classes of loans is limited by state and federal law. At certain times in the past, these limitations have resulted in reductions of net interest margins on certain classes of loans. Federal and state laws impose additional restrictions on the lending activities of banks. The maximum amount that a Missouri state-chartered bank may lend to any one person or entity is generally limited to 15% of the unimpaired capital of the bank located in a city having a population of 100,000 or more, 20% of the unimpaired capital of the bank located in a city having a population of less than 100,000 and over 7,000, and 25% of the unimpaired capital of the bank if located elsewhere in the state. In the case of Missouri state-chartered banks with a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Capital, Assets, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity (CAMELS) rating system, the maximum amount is the greater of (i) the limits listed in the foregoing sentence or (ii) 25% of the unimpaired capital of the bank.

&#160; 

Payment of Dividends. The Company's primary source of funds is dividends from the Bank, and the Bank is subject to federal and state laws limiting the payment of dividends. Under the FDIA, an FDIC-insured institution may not pay dividends while it is undercapitalized or if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized. The National Bank Act and Missouri banking law also prohibit the declaration of a dividend out of the capital and surplus of the bank.

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the CRA and implementing regulations. The CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the bank regulatory agencies assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. CRA ratings are taken into account by regulators in reviewing certain applications made by Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Hawthorn and its non-bank subsidiaries are &#34;affiliates&#34; within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act. The amount of loans or extensions of credit which the Bank may make to non-bank affiliates, or to third parties secured by securities or obligations of the non-bank affiliates, are substantially limited by the Federal Reserve Act and the FDIA. Such acts further restrict the range of permissible transactions between a bank and an affiliated company. A bank and its subsidiaries may engage in certain transactions, including loans and purchases of assets, with an affiliated company only if the terms and conditions of the transaction, including credit standards, are substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to the bank as, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and conditions that would be offered to non-affiliated companies.

&#160; 

Other Banking Activities. The investments and activities of the Bank are also subject to regulation by federal and state banking agencies regarding, among other things, investments in subsidiaries, investments for their own account (including limitations on investments in junk bonds and equity securities), loans to officers, directors and their affiliates, security requirements, anti-tying limitations, anti-money laundering, financial privacy and customer identity verification requirements, truth-in-lending, the types of interest bearing deposit accounts which it can offer, trust department operations, brokered deposits, audit requirements, issuance of securities, branching and mergers and acquisitions.

Changes in Laws and Monetary Policies

&#160; 

Recent Legislation. Various pieces of legislation, including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system, are from time to time introduced and considered by the Missouri state legislature and the United States Congress. In July 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#34;Dodd-Frank Act&#34;), which enacted substantial changes to the legal framework of the entire financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates the passage of numerous rules and regulations by various regulatory agencies over the next few years. It also creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will overtake supervision of most providers of consumer financial products and services, and will be empowered to declare acts or practices related to the delivery of a consumer financial product or service to be &#34;unfair, deceptive or abusive.&#34; This law will continue to change banking regulation and the operating environment of Hawthorn in substantial and unpredictable ways. These changes could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. Hawthorn cannot predict the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act, and the various regulations issued thereunder will have on its business.

&#160; 

Fiscal Monetary Policies. Hawthorn's business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Hawthorn is particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are:

&#160;

&#183; conducting open market operations in United States government securities; &#160;

&#183; changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions; &#160;

&#183; imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions' deposits; and &#160;

&#183; imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by bank and their affiliates. &#160;

These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB have a material effect on Hawthorn's business, results of operations and financial condition.
