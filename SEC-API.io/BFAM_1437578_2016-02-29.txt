 Item 1. Business &#32; 

Our Company 

We are a leading provider of high-quality child care, early education and other services designed to help employers and families better address the challenges of work and family life. We provide services primarily under multi-year contracts with employers who offer child care and other dependent care solutions as part of their employee benefits packages to improve employee engagement, productivity, recruitment and retention. As of December 31, 2015 , we had more than 1,000 &#32;client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 140 &#32;Fortune 500 companies and more than 80 &#32;of Working Mother &#32;magazine&#8217;s 2015 &#32;&#8220;100 Best Companies for Working Mothers.&#8221; Our service offerings include: 

&#8226; 

Center-based full service child care and early education (representing approximately 85% &#32;of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015 ); 

&#8226; 

Back-up dependent care; and 

&#8226; 

Educational advisory services. 

We believe we are a provider of choice for each of the solutions we offer. As of December 31, 2015 , we operated a total of 932 &#32;child care and early education centers across a wide range of customer industries with the capacity to serve approximately 107,000 &#32;children in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada and India. We have achieved satisfaction ratings of approximately 95% &#32;among respondents in our employer and parent satisfaction surveys over each of the past six &#32;years and an annual client retention rate of 97% &#32;for employer-sponsored centers over each of the past 10 &#32;years. 

Our History 

Since 1986, we have operated child care and early education centers for employers and working families. In 1998, we transformed our business through the merger of Bright Horizons, Inc. and Corporate Family Solutions, Inc., both then Nasdaq-listed companies that were founded in 1986 and 1987, respectively. We were listed on Nasdaq from 1998 to May 2008, when we were acquired by investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners LLC (collectively, the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;), which we refer to as our going private transaction. Since then, we have continued to grow through challenging economic times while investing in our future. We have grown our international footprint to become a leader in the center-based child care market in the United Kingdom and have expanded into the Netherlands and India as a platform for further international expansion. In the United States, we have grown our partnerships with employer clients by expanding and enhancing our back-up dependent care services and by developing and growing our educational advisory services. We have invested in new technologies to better support our full suite of services and expanded our marketing efforts with additional focus on maximizing occupancy levels in centers where we can improve our economics with increased enrollment. On January 30, 2013, we completed our initial public offering (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;) and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;BFAM.&#8221; 

Industry Overview 

We compete in the global market for child care and early education services as well as the market for work/life services offered by employers as benefits to employees. The child care industry can generally be subdivided into center-based and home-based child care. We operate in the center-based market, which is highly fragmented. 

The center-based child care market includes both retail and employer-sponsored centers and can be further divided into full-service centers and back-up centers. The employer-sponsored model, which has been central to our business since we were founded in 1986, is characterized by a single employer or consortium of employers entering into a long-term contract for the provision of child care at a center located at or near the employer sponsor&#8217;s worksite. The employer sponsor generally funds the development as well as ongoing maintenance and repair of a child care center at or near its worksite and subsidizes the provision of child care services to make them more affordable for its employees. 

Additionally, we compete in the growing markets for back-up dependent care and educational advisory services, and we believe we are the largest and one of the only multi-national providers of back-up dependent care services. 

Industry Trends 

We believe that the following key factors contribute to growth in the markets for employer-sponsored child care and for back-up dependent care and educational advisory services. 

Increasing Participation by Women and Two Working Parent Families in the Workforce . A significant percentage of mothers currently participate in the workforce. In 2014, 64% of mothers with children under the age of 6 participated in the workforce in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We expect that the number of working mothers and 

two working parent families will continue to increase over time, resulting in an increase in the need for child care and other work/life services. In 2016, women are expected to earn 54% of all doctorate and professional degrees in the United States, according to a 2011 report by the Families and Work Institute. 

Greater Demand for High-Quality Center-Based Child Care and Early Education. We believe that recognition of the importance of early education and consistent quality child care has led to increased demand for higher-quality center-based care. In 1965, 8% of children under the age of 5 with working mothers were enrolled in center-based child care, compared to approximately 24% of such children by 2011, according to data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau. With the shift towards center-based care, there is an increased focus on the establishment of objective, standards-based methods of defining and measuring the quality of child care, such as accreditation. In a highly fragmented market comprised largely of center operators lacking scale, we believe this trend will favor larger industry participants with the size and capital resources to achieve quality standards on a consistent basis. 

Recognized Return on Investment to Employers. Based on studies we have conducted through our Horizons Workforce Consulting practice, we believe that employer sponsors of center-based child care and back-up dependent care services realize strong returns on their investments from reduced turnover and increased productivity. We estimate that users of our back-up dependent care services have been able to work, on average, six days annually that they otherwise would have missed due to breakdowns in child care arrangements. Additionally, according to a 2015 survey of our clients, 92% of respondents reported that access to dependable back-up dependent care helps them to focus on work and be more productive. We believe that this return on investment for employers will result in additional growth in employer-sponsored back-up dependent care services. 

Growing Global Demand for Child Care and Early Education Services . We expect that a long-term shift to service-based economies and an increasing emphasis on education by government and families will contribute to further growth in the global child care and early education market as well as the developing markets for back-up dependent care and educational advisory services. In addition, in certain countries in which we operate, public policy decisions have facilitated increased demand for child care and early education services. In 2006, the United Kingdom instituted a 10 year plan to make child care more accessible and more affordable for all parents. In the Netherlands, a 2005 child care law increased the demand for child care and early education services by making child care more affordable for working families and thereby encouraging women to return to the workforce. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

Market Leading Service Provider 

We believe we are the leader in the markets for employer-sponsored center-based child care and back-up dependent care, and that the breadth, depth and quality of our service offerings&#8212;developed over a successful 30-year history&#8212;represent significant competitive advantages. We have approximately six times more employer-sponsored centers in the United States than our closest competitor, according to Child Care Information Exchange&#8217;s 2010 Employer Child Care Trend Report . We believe the broad geographic reach of our child care centers, with targeted clusters in areas where we believe demand is generally higher and where income demographics are attractive, provides us with an effective platform to market our services to current and new clients. 

Collaborative, Long-term Relationships with Diverse Customer Base 

We have more than 1,000 &#32;client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 140 &#32;of the Fortune 500 companies, with our largest client contributing less than 2% &#32;of our revenue in fiscal 2015 &#32;and our largest 10 clients representing less than 10% &#32;of our revenue in the same year. Our business model emphasizes multi-year employer sponsorship contracts where our clients typically fund the development of new child care centers at or near to their worksites and frequently support the ongoing operations of these centers. 

Our multiple touch points with both employers and employees give us unique insight into the corporate culture of our clients. This enables us to identify and provide innovative and tailored solutions to address our clients&#8217; specific work/life needs. In addition to full service center-based care, we provide access to a multi-national back-up dependent care network and educational advisory support, allowing us to offer various combinations of services to best meet the needs of specific clients or specific locations for a single client. We believe our tailored, collaborative approach to employer-sponsored child care has resulted in an annual client retention rate for employer-sponsored centers of approximately 97% &#32;over each of the past ten years. 

Commitment to Quality 

Our business is anchored in our commitment to consistently provide high-quality service offerings to employers and families. We have therefore designed our child care centers to meet or exceed applicable accreditation and rating standards in all of our key markets, including in the United States through the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs, a division of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (&#8220;NAEYC&#8221;), and in the United Kingdom through the ratings of the Office of Standards in Education. We believe that our voluntary commitment to achieving accreditation standards offers 

a competitive advantage in securing employer sponsorship opportunities and in attracting and retaining families, because an increasing number of potential and existing employer clients require adherence to accreditation criteria. 

We maintain our proprietary curriculum at the forefront of early education practices by introducing elements that respond to the changing expectations and views of society and new information and theories about the ways in which children learn and grow. We also believe that strong adult-to-child ratios are a critical factor in delivering our curriculum effectively as well as helping to facilitate more focused care. Our programs often provide adult-to-child ratios that are more stringent than many state licensing standards. 

Market Leading People Practices 

Our ability to deliver consistently high-quality care, education and other services is directly related to our ability to attract, retain and motivate our highly skilled workforce. We have consistently been named as a top employer by third-party sources in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, including being named as one of the &#8220;100 Best Places to Work in America&#8221; by Fortune Magazine &#32; 16 &#32;times. 

We believe the education and experience of our center leaders and teachers exceed the industry average. In addition to recurring in-center training and partial tuition reimbursement for continuing education, we have developed a training program that establishes standards for our teachers as well as an in-house online training academy, which allows our employees to earn nationally-recognized child development credentials. 

Capital Efficient Operating Model Provides Platform for Growth, with Attractive Economics 

We have achieved uninterrupted year-over-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for each of the last 14 years despite broader macro-economic fluctuations. With employer sponsors funding the majority of the capital required for new centers developed on their behalf, we have been able to grow our business with limited capital investment, which has contributed to strong cash flows from operations. 

Proven Acquisition Track Record 

We have an established acquisition team to pursue potential targets using a proven framework to effectively evaluate potential transactions with the goal of maximizing our return on investment while minimizing risk. Since 2006, and as of December 31, 2015 , we have completed acquisitions of 299 &#32;child care centers in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as providers of back-up dependent care services and educational advisory services in the United States. 

Our Growth Strategy 

We believe that there are significant opportunities to continue to grow our business globally and expand our leadership position by continuing to execute on the following strategies. 

Grow Our Client Relationships 

&#8226; 

Secure Relationships with New Employer Clients. Our addressable market includes approximately 15,000 &#32;employers, each with at least 1,000 &#32;employees, within the industries that we currently service in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our dedicated sales force focuses on establishing new client relationships and is supported by our Horizons Workforce Consulting practice, which helps potential clients to identify the precise work/life offerings that will best meet their strategic goals. 

&#8226; 

Cross-Sell and Expand Services to Existing Employer Clients. We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase the number of our clients that use more than one of our services, and to expand the services we provide to existing clients. 

&#8226; 

Continue to Expand Through the Assumption of Management of Existing Sponsored Child Care Centers. We occasionally assume the management of existing centers from the incumbent management team, which enables us to develop new client relationships, typically with no capital investment and no purchase price payment. 

Sustain Annual Price Increases to Enable Continued Investments in Quality 

We look for opportunities to invest in quality as a way to enhance our reputation with our clients and their employees. By developing a strong reputation for high-quality services and facilities, we are able to support consistent price increases that keep pace with our cost increases. Over our history, these price increases have contributed to our revenue growth and have enabled us to drive margin expansion. 

Increase Utilization at Existing Centers 

We believe that our mature profit and loss centers (centers that have been open for more than three years, as more fully described below) are currently operating at utilization levels below our target run rate, in part due to a general deterioration in economic condition from 2008 to 2010. Utilization rates at our mature profit and loss centers stabilized in 2010 and have grown since. We expect to further close the gap between current utilization rates and our target run rate over the next few years. 

Selectively Add New Lease/Consortium Centers and Expand Through Selective Acquisitions 

We have typically added approximately fifteen new lease/consortium centers (as more fully described below) annually for the past three years, focusing on urban or city surrounding markets where demand is generally higher and where income demographics are generally more supportive of a new center. In addition, we have a long track record of successfully completing and integrating selective acquisitions. The domestic and international markets for child care and other family support services remain highly fragmented. We will therefore continue to seek attractive opportunities both for center acquisitions and the acquisition of complementary service offerings. 

Our Operations 

Our primary reporting and operating segments are full-service center-based child care services and back-up dependent care services. Full-service center-based child care includes traditional center-based child care, preschool and elementary education. Back-up dependent care includes center-based back-up child care, in-home care, mildly-ill child care and adult/elder care. Our remaining operations, including our educational advisory services, are included in other educational advisory services. 

The following table sets forth our segment information as of the dates and for the periods indicated. Additional segment information is included in Note 16, "Segment and Geographic Information," included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Full-Service Center-Based Child Care Services 

We provide our center-based child care services under two general business models: a profit and loss (&#8220;P&#38;L&#8221;) model, where we assume the financial risk of operating a child care center; and a cost-plus model, where we are paid a fee by an employer client for managing a child care center on a cost-plus basis. The P&#38;L model is further classified into two subcategories: 

&#8226; 

a sponsor model, where we provide child care and early education services on either an exclusive or priority enrollment basis for the employees of a specific employer sponsor; and 

&#8226; 

a lease/consortium model, where we provide child care and early education services to the employees of multiple employers located within a specific real estate development (for example, an office building or office park), as well as to families in the surrounding community. 

In both our cost-plus and sponsor P&#38;L models, the development of a new child care center, as well as ongoing maintenance and repair, is typically funded by an employer sponsor with whom we enter into a multi-year contractual relationship. In addition, employer sponsors typically provide subsidies for the ongoing provision of child care services for their employees. 

Our full-service center operations are organized into geographic divisions led by a Division Vice President of Center Operations who, in turn, reports to a Senior Vice President of Center Operations. Each division is further divided into regions, each supervised by a Regional Manager who oversees the operational performance of approximately six to eight centers and is responsible for supervising the program quality, financial performance and client relationships. A typical center is managed by a small administrative team under the leadership of a Center Director. A Center Director has day-to-day operating responsibility for the center, including training, management of staff, licensing compliance, implementation of curricula, conducting child assessments and enrollment. Our corporate offices provide centralized administrative support for accounting, finance, information systems, legal, payroll, risk management, marketing and human resources functions. We follow this underlying operational structure for center operations in each country in which we operate. 

Center hours of operation are designed to match the schedules of employer sponsors and working families. Most of our centers are open 10 to 12 hours a day with typical hours of operation from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. We offer a variety of enrollment options, ranging from full-time to part-time scheduling. 

Tuition paid by families varies depending on the age of the child, the child's attendance schedule, the geographic location and the extent to which an employer sponsor subsidizes tuition. Based on a sample of 320 &#32;of our child care and early education centers, the average tuition rate at our centers in the United States is $1,775 &#32;per month for infants (typically ages three to sixteen months), $1,625 &#32;per month for toddlers (typically ages sixteen months to three years) and $1,300 &#32;per month for preschoolers (typically ages 3 to 5 years). Tuition at most of our child care and early education centers is payable in advance and is due either monthly or weekly. In many cases, families can pay tuition through payroll deductions or through Automated Clearing House withdrawals. 

Revenue per center typically averages between $ 1.5 million &#32;and $1.7 million &#32;at our centers in North America, and averages between $0.9 million &#32;and $1.4 million &#32;at our centers in Europe, primarily due to the larger average size of our centers in North America. Gross margin at our centers typically averages between 20% &#32;and 25% , with our cost-plus model centers typically at the lower end of that range and our lease/consortium centers at the higher end. 

Cost of services consists of direct expenses associated with the operation of child care and early education primarily comprised of payroll and benefits for personnel, food costs, program supplies and materials, parent marketing and facilities costs, which include depreciation. Personnel costs are the largest component of a center&#8217;s operating costs and comprise approximately 70% &#32;of a center&#8217;s operating expenses. In a P&#38;L model center, we are often responsible for additional costs that are typically paid or provided directly by a client in centers operating under the cost-plus model, such as facilities costs. As a result, personnel costs in centers operating under P&#38;L models will often represent a smaller percentage of overall costs when compared to centers operating under cost-plus models. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses (&#8220;SGA&#8221;) consist primarily of salaries, payroll taxes and benefits (including stock-based compensation costs) for non-center personnel, which includes corporate, regional and business development personnel, accounting and legal, information technology, occupancy costs for corporate and regional personnel, management/advisory fees and other general corporate expenses. 

Back-Up Dependent Care Services 

We provide back-up dependent care services through our full-service centers or our dedicated back-up centers, as well as through our Back-Up Care Advantage (&#8220;BUCA&#8221;) program. BUCA offers access to a contracted network of in-home care agencies and approximately 3,000 &#32;center-based providers in locations where we do not otherwise have centers with available capacity. 

Our back-up dependent care division is led by an Executive Vice President of Operations, with a Senior Vice President leading the BUCA program and a Divisional Vice President leading back-up center operations. The dedicated back-up centers that we operate are organized in a similar structure to full-service centers, with Regional Managers overseeing approximately six to eight centers each and with center-based administrative teams that mirror the administrative teams in full-service centers. The dedicated back-up centers are either exclusive to a single employer or are consortium centers that have multiple employer sponsors, as well as uses from the BUCA program. Care is arranged through a 24 hours-a-day contact center, online or via our mobile application, allowing employees to reserve care in advance or at the last minute. We operate our own contact center in Broomfield, Colorado, which is overseen by the Senior Vice President responsible for BUCA, and contract with additional 

contact centers located in Durham, North Carolina, and Chicago, Illinois, to complement our ability to handle demand fluctuations and to provide seamless service 24 hours a day. 

Back-up dependent care revenue is comprised of fees or subsidies paid by employer sponsors, as well as co-payments collected from users at the point of service. Cost of services consist of fees paid to providers for care delivered as part of their contractual relationships with us, personnel and related direct service costs of the contact centers and any other expenses related to the coordination or delivery of care and service. For Bright Horizons back-up centers, cost of services also includes all direct expenses associated with the operation of the centers. SGA related to back-up dependent care is similar to SGA for full-service care, with additional expenses related to the information technology necessary to operate this service, the ongoing development and maintenance of the provider network and additional personnel needed as a result of more significant client management and reporting requirements. 

Educational Advisory Services 

Our educational advisory services consist of our EdAssist and College Coach services. Educational advisory services revenue is comprised of fees or subsidies paid by employer clients, as well as co-payments or retail fees collected from users at the point of service. Cost of services consist of personnel and direct service costs of the contact centers, and other expenses related to the coordination and delivery of advisory and counseling services. 

EdAssist. EdAssist provides tuition reimbursement administration for corporate clients. Administration services are provided through a proprietary software system for processing and data analytics, as well as a team of compliance professionals who audit employee reimbursements. We also provide educational advising to client employees on a one-on-one basis through our team of advisors, who help employees make better decisions regarding their education. Customer service is also provided through contact centers in Broomfield, Colorado and Durham, North Carolina. The EdAssist services derive revenue directly from fees paid by employer sponsors under contracts that are typically three years in length. The EdAssist division is managed by a Vice President and a General Manager who have responsibility for the growth and profitability of this division. 

College Coach. College Coach provides college advisory services through our team of educators, all of whom have experience working at senior levels in admissions or financial aid at colleges and universities. We work with employer clients who offer these services as a benefit to their employees, and we also provide these services directly to families on a retail basis. We have 10 &#32;College Coach offices in the United States, located primarily in metropolitan areas, where we believe the demand for these services is greatest. College Coach derives revenue mainly from employer clients who contract with us for an agreed upon number of workshops, access to our proprietary online learning center and individual counseling. The College Coach division is managed by a Senior Vice President who has responsibility for the growth and profitability of this division. 

Seasonality 

Our business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations. Demand for child care and early education and elementary school services has historically decreased during the summer months when school is not in session, at which time families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements. In addition, our enrollment declines as older children transition to elementary schools. Demand for our services generally increases in September and October coinciding with the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the school year. In addition, use of our back-up dependent care services tends to be higher when schools are not in session and during holiday periods, which can increase the operating costs of the program and impact the results of operations. Results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of, among other things, the performance of existing centers, including enrollment and staffing fluctuations, the number and timing of new center openings, acquisitions and management transitions, the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability, center closings, refurbishment or relocation, the contract model mix (P&#38;L versus cost-plus) of new and existing centers, the timing and level of sponsorship payments, competitive factors and general economic conditions. 

Geography 

We operate in two primary regions: North America, which includes the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, and Europe, which we define to include the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland and India. The following table sets forth certain financial data for these geographic regions for the periods indicated.

Our international business primarily consists of child care centers throughout the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and is overseen by a Senior Vice President. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 240 &#32;centers in Europe and 692 &#32;centers in North America. 

Marketing 

We market our services to prospective employer sponsors, current clients and their employees, and to parents. Our sales force is organized on both a centralized and regional basis and is responsible for identifying potential employer sponsors, targeting real estate development opportunities, identifying potential acquisitions and managing the overall sales process. We reach out to employers via word of mouth, direct mail campaigns, digital outreach and advertising, conference networking, webinars and social media. In addition, as a result of our visibility among human resources professionals as a high-quality dependent care service provider, potential employer sponsors regularly contact us requesting proposals, and we often compete for employer-sponsorship opportunities through request for proposal processes. Our management team is involved at the national level with education, work/life and children&#8217;s advocacy, and we believe that their prominence and involvement in such issues also helps us attract new business. We communicate regularly with existing clients to increase awareness of the full suite of services that we provide for key life stages and to explore opportunities to enhance current partnerships. 

We also have a direct-to-consumer, or parent, marketing department that supports parent enrollment efforts through the development of marketing programs, including the preparation of promotional materials. The parent marketing team is organized on both a centralized and regional basis and works with center directors and our contact centers to build enrollment. New enrollment is generated by word of mouth, print advertising, direct mail campaigns, digital marketing, parent referral programs and business outreach. Individual centers may receive assistance from employer sponsors, who often provide access to channels of internal communication, such as e-mail, websites, intranets, mailing lists and internal publications. In addition, many employer sponsors promote the child care and early education center as an important employee benefit. 

Competition 

We believe that we are a leader in the markets for employer-sponsored center-based child care and back-up dependent care. We maintain approximately six times more market share in the United States than our closest competitors who provide employer-sponsored center-based child care. The market for child care and early education services is highly fragmented, and we compete for enrollment and for sponsorship of child care and early education centers with a variety of other businesses including large community-based child care companies, regional child care providers, family day care (operated out of the caregiver&#8217;s home), nannies, for-profit and not-for-profit full- and part-time nursery schools, private schools and public elementary schools, and not-for-profit and government-funded providers of center-based child care. Our principal competitors for employer-sponsored centers include KinderCare Education, New Horizons Academy, Childbase and Busy Bees in the United States and the United Kingdom. Competition for back-up dependent care and educational advising comes from some of 

these same competitors in addition to employee assistance programs, payment processors and smaller work/life companies. In addition, we compete for enrollment on a center-by-center basis with some of the providers named above, along with many local and national providers, such as Learning Care Group, Goddard Schools, Primrose Preschools, Asquith Day Nurseries, The Co-operative Childcare, Smallsteps, and Partou in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. 

We believe that the key factors in the competition for enrollment are quality of care, site convenience and cost. We believe that many center-based child care providers are able to offer care at lower prices than we do by utilizing less intensive adult-to-child ratios and offering their staff lower compensation and limited or less affordable benefits. While our tuition levels are generally higher than our competitors, we compete primarily based on the convenience of a work-site location and a higher level of program quality. In addition, many of our competitors may have access to greater financial resources (such as access to government funding or other subsidies), or may benefit from broader name recognition (such as established regional providers) or comply, or are required to comply, with fewer or less costly health, safety, and operational regulations than those with which we comply (such as the more limited health, safety and operational regulatory requirements typically applicable to family day care operations in caregivers&#8217; homes).We believe that our primary focus on employer clients and track record for achieving and maintaining high-quality standards distinguishes us from our competitors. We believe we are well-positioned to continue attracting new employer sponsors due to our extensive service offerings, established reputation, position as a quality leader and track record of serving major employer sponsors for 30 years. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that our name and logo have significant value and are important to our operations. We own and use various registered and unregistered trademarks covering the names Bright Horizons and Bright Horizons Family Solutions, our logo and a number of other names, slogans and designs. We frequently license the use of our registered trademarks to our clients in connection with the use of our services, subject to customary restrictions. We actively protect our trademarks by registering the marks in a variety of countries and geographic areas, including North America, Asia and Southeast Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe and Australia. These registrations are subject to varying terms and renewal options. However, not all of the trademarks or service marks have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and we are aware of persons using similar marks in certain countries in which we currently do not do business. Meanwhile, we monitor our trademarks and vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our marks. We do not hold any patents, and we hold copyright registrations for certain materials that are important to the operation of our business. We generally rely on common law protection for those copyrighted works which are not critical to the operation of our business. We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our business. Such licenses are not individually or in the aggregate material to our business. 

Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our business, including various licensing, health, fire and safety requirements and standards. In most jurisdictions in which we operate, our child care centers are required by law to meet a variety of operational requirements, including minimum qualifications and background checks for our teachers and other center personnel. State and local regulations may also impact the design and furnishing of our centers. 

Internationally, we are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting us in the United States, including laws and regulations concerning various licensing, health, fire and safety requirements and standards. We believe that our centers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations in these countries. 

Health and Safety 

The safety and well-being of children and our employees is paramount for us. We employ a variety of security measures at our child care and early education centers, which typically include secure electronic access systems as well as sign-in and sign-out procedures for children, among other site-specific security measures. In addition, our trained teachers and open center designs help ensure the health and safety of children. Our child care and early education centers are designed to minimize the risk of injury to children by incorporating such features as child-sized amenities, rounded corners on furniture and fixtures, age-appropriate toys and equipment and cushioned fall zones surrounding play structures. 

Each center is further guided by a policies and procedures manual and a center management guide that address protocols for safe and appropriate care of children and center administration. These guidelines establish center protocols in areas including the safe handling of medications, managing child illness or health emergencies and a variety of other critical aspects of care to ensure that centers meet or exceed all mandated licensing standards. The center management guide is reviewed and updated continuously by a team of internal experts, and center personnel are trained on center practices using this tool. Our proprietary We Care &#32;system supports proper supervision of children and documents the transitions of children to and from the care of teachers and parents or from one classroom to another during the day. 

Environmental 

Our operations, including the selection and development of the properties that we lease and any construction or improvements that we make at those locations, are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including environmental, zoning and land use requirements. In addition, we have a practice of conducting site evaluations on each freestanding or newly constructed or renovated property that we own or lease. Although we have no known material environmental liabilities, environmental laws may require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property, regardless of fault. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 26,000 &#32;employees (including part-time and substitute teachers), of whom approximately 1,500 &#32;were employed at our corporate, divisional and regional offices, and the remainders of whom were employed at our child care and early education centers. Child care and early education center employees include teachers and support personnel. The total number of employees includes approximately 6,000 &#32;employees working outside of the United States. We conduct annual surveys to assess employee satisfaction and can adjust programs, benefits offerings, trainings, communications and other support to meet employee needs and enhance retention. We have a long track record of being named a &#8220;Best Place to Work&#8221; by Fortune Magazine &#32;in the United States and more recently in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands based largely upon employee responses to surveys. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe our relationships with our employees are good. 

Facilities 

Our child care and early education centers are primarily operated at work-site locations and vary in design and capacity in accordance with employer sponsor needs and state and local regulatory requirements. Our North American child care and early education centers typically have an average capacity of 127 &#32;children. Our locations in Europe and India have an average capacity of 79 &#32;children. As of December 31, 2015 , our child care and early education centers had a total licensed capacity of approximately 107,000 &#32;children, with the smallest center having a capacity of 12 &#32;children and the largest having a capacity of approximately 523 &#32;children. 

We believe that attractive, spacious and child-friendly facilities with warm, nurturing and welcoming atmospheres are an important element in fostering a high-quality learning environment for children. Our centers are designed to be open and bright and to maximize supervision visibility. We devote considerable resources to equipping our centers with child-sized amenities, indoor and outdoor play areas comprised of age-appropriate materials and design, family hospitality areas and computer centers. Commercial kitchens are typically only present in those centers where regulations require that hot meals be prepared on site.
