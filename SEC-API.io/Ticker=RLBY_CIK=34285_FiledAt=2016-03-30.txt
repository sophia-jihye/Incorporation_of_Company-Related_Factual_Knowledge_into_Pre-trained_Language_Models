THE COMPANY

&#160;

Reliability Incorporated ("we", "our", "or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas in 1953, and from 1971 to 2007 the Company was principally engaged in the design, manufacture, market, and support of high performance equipment used to test and condition integrated circuits. This business was closed down in 2007. The Company has no further operating activities and is now a shell company.

&#160;

The Company has concluded that it should look for acquisitions or identify a merger partner or other business combination. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in completing such a transaction or be able to maintain sufficient liquidity over a period of time that will allow it to carry out this action.

&#160;

The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Copies of this Annual Report, including our financial statements, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as other corporate information, including press releases, of interest to our stockholders are available by writing us at 53 Forest Avenue - First Floor, Old Greenwich, Connecticut 06870.

Available sources of liquidity at December 31, 2015 include cash and cash equivalents of $11,924.

&#160;

The Company's common stock is a "penny stock," as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as the Company's common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, the level of trading activity could be limited and it may be difficult for investors to sell our common stock.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES

&#160;

The Company has no employees. It is managed by two directors/officers, with assistance from a contract bookkeeper.
