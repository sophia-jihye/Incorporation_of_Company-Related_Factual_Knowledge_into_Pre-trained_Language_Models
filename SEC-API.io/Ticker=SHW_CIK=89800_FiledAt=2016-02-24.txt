Basis of Reportable Segments 

We report our segment information in the same way that management internally organizes our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). We have four reportable operating segments: Paint Stores Group, Consumer Group, Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group (individually, a "Reportable Segment" and collectively, the &#8220;Reportable Segments&#8221;). Factors considered in determining our Reportable Segments include the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker (CODM) for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information and information presented to our Board of Directors. We report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative segment. For more information about the Reportable Segments, see pages 8 &#32;through 17 &#32;of our 2015 &#32;Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

The Company&#8217;s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial information about each Reportable Segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the Reportable Segments based on profit or loss before income taxes and cash generated from operations. The accounting policies of the Reportable Segments are the same as those described in Note 1 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 46 &#32;through 49 &#32;of our 2015 &#32;Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Paint Stores Group 

The Paint Stores Group consisted of 4,086 &#32;company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Maarten, Jamaica, Curacao, Aruba and St. Lucia at December 31, 2015 . Each store in this segment is engaged in the related business activity of selling paint, coatings and related products to end-use customers. The Paint Stores Group markets and sells Sherwin-Williams &#174; &#32;branded architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) product finishes and related items. These products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Group. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment. During 2015 , this segment opened 83 &#32;net new stores, consisting of 113 &#32;new stores opened ( 99 &#32;in the United States, 12 &#32;in Canada, 1 &#32;in Puerto Rico and 1 &#32;in Trinidad and Tobago) and 30 &#32;stores closed ( 25 &#32;in the United States and 5 &#32;in Canada). During 2014 , this segment opened 95 &#32;net new stores. During 2013 , this segment acquired 306 &#32;stores and opened 82 &#32;net new stores. A map on the cover flap of our 2015 &#32;Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the number of paint stores and their geographic locations. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Paint Stores Group, supplemented with information by geographic region, product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Paint 

Stores Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Paint Stores Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment. 

Consumer Group 

The Consumer Group develops, manufactures and distributes a variety of paint, coatings and related products to third party customers primarily in the United States and Canada and the Paint Stores Group. Approximately 63 percent &#32;of the total sales of the Consumer Group in 2015 &#32;were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through the Paint Stores Group. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private labeled products are performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company&#8217;s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Consumer Group, supplemented with information by product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Consumer Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Consumer Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment. 

Global Finishes Group 

The Global Finishes Group develops, licenses, manufactures, distributes and sells a variety of protective and marine products, automotive finishes and refinish products, OEM product finishes and related products in North and South America, Europe and Asia. This segment meets the demands of its customers for a consistent worldwide product development, manufacturing and distribution presence and approach to doing business. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams &#174; &#32;and other controlled brand products are distributed through the Paint Stores Group and this segment&#8217;s 296 &#32;company-operated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third party distributors. During 2015 , this segment opened 3 &#32;new branches ( 2 &#32;in Canada and 1 &#32;in Mexico) and closed 7 &#32;branches ( 5 &#32;in the United States and 2 &#32;in Chile) for a net decrease of 4 &#32;branches. At December 31, 2015 , the Global Finishes Group consisted of operations in the United States, subsidiaries in 35 foreign countries and income from licensing agreements in 15 &#32;foreign countries. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Global Finishes Group, supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units, and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Global Finishes Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Global Finishes Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment. A map on the cover flap of our 2015 &#32;Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the number of branches and their geographic locations. 

Latin America Coatings Group 

The Latin America Coatings Group develops, licenses, manufactures, distributes and sells a variety of architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products in North and South America. This segment meets the demands of its customers for consistent regional product development, manufacturing and distribution presence and approach to doing business. Sherwin-Williams &#174; &#32;and other controlled brand products are distributed through this segment&#8217;s 291 &#32;company-operated stores and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, licensees and other third party distributors. During 2015 , this segment opened 17 &#32;new stores ( 11 &#32;in South America and 6 &#32;in Mexico) and closed 2 &#32;stores ( 1 &#32;in South America and 1 &#32;in Mexico) for a net increase &#32;of 15 &#32;stores. At December 31, 2015 , the Latin America Coatings Group consisted of operations from subsidiaries in 9 &#32;foreign countries, 4 &#32;foreign joint ventures and income from licensing agreements in 7 &#32;foreign countries. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Latin America Coatings Group, supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units, and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Latin America Coatings Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Latin America Coatings Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment. A map on the cover flap of our 2015 &#32;Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the number of stores and their geographic locations. 

Administrative Segment 

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company&#8217;s corporate headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment was interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses which were not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The Administrative segment did not include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company&#8217;s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used 

by the Company in its primary businesses. Gains and losses from the sale of property were not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale 

We believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business. There are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the Reportable Segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2016 . See Item 1A Risk Factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials. 

Seasonality 

The majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment. 

Working Capital 

In order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company&#8217;s liquidity and capital resources, see pages 26 &#32;through 32 &#32;of our 2015 &#32;Annual Report under the caption &#8220;Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow&#8221; of &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; which is incorporated herein by reference.

Backlog and Productive Capacity 

Backlog orders are not significant in the business of any Reportable Segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. We believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products through 2016 . 

Research and Development

Competition

We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our different products and markets.

Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.
