 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

FedEx Corporation (&#147;FedEx&#148;) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in the following business segments: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; FedEx Express : Federal Express Corporation (&#147;FedEx Express&#148;) is the world&#146;s largest express transportation company, offering time-definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories, connecting markets that comprise more than 90% of the world&#146;s gross domestic product. The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade Networks, Inc. (&#147;FedEx Trade Networks&#148;), which provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding, FedEx SupplyChain Systems, Inc. (&#147;FedEx SupplyChain&#148;), which offers a range of supply chain solutions, and FedEx CrossBorder, LLC, formerly Bongo International, LLC (&#147;FedEx CrossBorder&#148;), which is a leader in cross-border enablement technology and solutions. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; TNT Express : Acquired near the end of our 2016 fourth quarter, TNT Express B.V., formerly TNT Express N.V. (&#147;TNT Express&#148;), is an international express transportation, small-package ground delivery and freight transportation company. TNT Express services are primarily classified by the speed, distance, weight and size of consignments. While a majority of its shipments are between businesses, TNT Express also offers business-to-consumer services to select key customers. TNT Express operates road transportation networks and delivers to over 200 countries. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; FedEx Ground : FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (&#147;FedEx Ground&#148;) is a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the U.S. and Canada, as well as residential delivery to 100% of U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. On August 31, 2015, our FedEx SmartPost business was merged into FedEx Ground. The FedEx SmartPost service specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages using the U.S. Postal Service (&#147;USPS&#148;) for final delivery to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S. and remains an important component of our FedEx Ground service offerings. The FedEx Ground segment also includes GENCO Distribution System, Inc. (&#147;GENCO&#148;), which is a leading North American third-party logistics provider. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; FedEx Freight : FedEx Freight, Inc. (&#147;FedEx Freight&#148;) is a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload (&#147;LTL&#148;) freight services across all lengths of haul, offering: FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet supply chain needs; and FedEx Freight Economy, when time can be traded for cost savings. The FedEx Freight segment also offers freight delivery service to most points in Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and includes FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (&#147;FedEx Custom Critical&#148;), a leading North American provider of time-specific, critical shipment services. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; FedEx Services : FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (&#147;FedEx Services&#148;) provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office functions that support our other companies. The FedEx Services segment includes FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (&#147;FedEx Office&#148;), which provides document and business services and retail access to our package transportation businesses. On May 31, 2016, FedEx TechConnect, Inc. (&#147;FedEx TechConnect&#148;) was merged into FedEx Services. Following the merger, the services previously provided by FedEx TechConnect, including customer service and billing and collection services for our U.S. customers and technical support services, are now performed by FedEx Services.

Strategy 

FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services. 

We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units. For example, our website, fedex.com , provides a single point of contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipping, pickup, shipment tracking, customer service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly, by making one call to FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup-and-delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped. Also, we have integrated our U.S. LTL and parcel sales teams to enhance the effectiveness of our sales efforts and provide additional simplicity for our customers. 

We manage our business as a portfolio &#151; in the long-term best interest of the enterprise, not a particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings 

&#160; 

- 4 - 

performance and cash flow. We are also focused on increasing returns to our stockholders, as evidenced by the recent increase in our quarterly dividend. 

While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit. Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers. Each company&#146;s operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result, we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs. 

Our &#147;compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively&#148; strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy. In 2014, we began replacing some of our retired aircraft with the more efficient, lower-emission Boeing 767-300 Freighter (&#147;B767F&#148;) aircraft. The B767F aircraft is approximately 30% more fuel efficient and has unit operating costs that are more than 20% lower than the MD10 aircraft it is replacing. In 2015, to continue rationalizing capacity and modernizing our aircraft fleet to more effectively serve customers, we retired an additional 15 aircraft and 21 related engines and adjusted the retirement schedule of 23 aircraft and 57 engines. 

At the same time, we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful FedEx Ground segment where we continue to boost package volumes. 

TNT Express is the largest acquisition in FedEx history. The addition of TNT Express expands our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, and will lower our cost to serve European markets by increasing density in our pickup-and-delivery operations and accelerate our global growth. We will enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT Express&#146;s low-cost road networks in different regions around the world. We have begun the process of integrating the TNT Express operations with the FedEx Express network. Although the integration will take several years to fully execute, TNT Express and FedEx Express have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world. 

The following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace, and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Growth of E-Commerce: E-commerce continues to be a catalyst for the other trends below and is a vital growth engine for businesses, as the internet is increasingly being used to purchase goods and services. Through our global transportation and technology networks, we contribute to and benefit from the growth of e-commerce. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Globalization: As the world&#146;s economy has become more fully integrated, companies are sourcing and selling globally. With customers in more than 220 countries and territories, we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach, delivery services and information capabilities. Despite the recent slow-down in global trade growth, we continue to believe that globalization will drive international volume growth over the long term. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Supply Chain Acceleration: While the growth of global trade has slowed, companies of all sizes continue to depend on the delivery of just-in-time inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the move toward more efficient supply chains by helping customers obtain more visibility into their supply chains and near real-time information to manage inventory in motion, thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding time-to-market. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added Businesses: High-tech and high-value-added goods have increased as a percentage of total economic output, and our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and high-value-added industries. 

&#160; 

- 5 - 

The growth of e-commerce over the last several years has been significant. According to third-party reports, total e-commerce activity now accounts for one in six discretionary dollars spent by consumers. If this trend continues, calendar year 2016 will be the seventh consecutive year that online sales grew near or above 15% year-over-year. We believe that FedEx is well positioned to provide innovative solutions to meet the growing demand of e-commerce. FedEx continues to invest in growth at FedEx Ground in order to take advantage of opportunities in the business-to-consumer market in the U.S. GENCO has a broad portfolio of returns services to meet the needs of e-commerce merchants and customers. 

These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access &#151; to goods, services and information. Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability. To this end, we are investing in long-term strategic projects focused on expanding and modernizing our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience, such as investments in Boeing 777 Freighter (&#147;B777F&#148;) and B767F aircraft. We also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers. For example, during 2016, we: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Made the strategic acquisition of TNT Express, which will allow us to more quickly broaden our portfolio of international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends, especially the continuing growth in e-commerce. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Continued the integration of GENCO, a leading North American third-party logistics provider, allowing us to expand our service offerings in the growing e-commerce marketplace. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Continued to reduce transit times and provide a better pickup experience within FedEx Ground&#146;s growing and highly profitable network. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Successfully integrated Bongo International, LLC (&#147;Bongo&#148;) and rebranded it as FedEx CrossBorder, a leader in cross-border enablement technologies and solutions, which has capabilities that complement and expand the FedEx portfolio of offerings important to the rapidly growing global e-commerce market. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Enhanced service offerings at FedEx Office through the eBay Valet Drop-Off program, a collaboration with eBay, Inc. (&#147;eBay&#148;) that allows customers to bring items to a FedEx Office location to be packed and shipped to an eBay processing center to be sold. FedEx Office also introduced a faster, cost-effective and streamlined system of delivering professional print services to large, commercial customers. 

Profit Improvement Initiatives 

During 2013, we saw challenging global economic conditions &#151; particularly for FedEx Express &#151; as ongoing shifts from priority to deferred shipping services significantly impacted profitability. In response to these trends, in 2013 we announced programs targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion at FedEx Express. Our profit improvement programs included multiple initiatives, primarily across FedEx Express and FedEx Services, to reduce our overall cost structure and enhancing the quality of our revenue. 

&#160; 

- 6 - 

We exited 2016 having achieved our profit improvement goals with a run rate of $1.6 billion of additional operating profit from the then 2013 base business. FedEx Express has improved operating income by approximately 170% from 2013, despite lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable exchange rates driving flat to declining revenue during the four-year period. FedEx Services has reduced its total expenses while investing in major information technology transformation projects. In addition, our incentive compensation programs have been gradually reinstated so that 2017 business plan objectives will represent more fully funded compensation targets. While this program is completed, assuming continued modest growth in the U.S. and global economies, our profitability and productivity are expected to continue to increase for years to come as we further leverage the benefits of these initiatives and fully integrate our recent business acquisitions. 

Reputation and Responsibility 

By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the world&#146;s most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2016, FedEx ranked 8th in FORTUNE magazine&#146;s &#147;World&#146;s Most Admired Companies&#148; list &#151; the 15th consecutive year we have been ranked in the top 20 on the list. Additionally, FedEx ranked in the top 50 on the Reputation Institute&#146;s 2016 &#147;Most Reputable Companies in the U.S.&#148; list, which measures the corporate reputations of the largest U.S. companies based on consumers&#146; trust, esteem, admiration and good feeling towards a company. Lastly, in 2016 FedEx was again listed on Corporate Responsibility Magazine&#146;s &#147;100 Best Corporate Citizens&#148; list. 

FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and for technological innovation, but also in global citizenship. We understand that a sustainable global business is tied to our global citizenship, and we are committed to connecting the world responsibly and resourcefully. Our latest published update to our global citizenship report is available at http://csr.fedex.com . These reports describe how we think about our responsibilities in the area of global citizenship and include important goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling these responsibilities. 

Our People 

Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For example, FedEx was once again named to Black Enterprise magazine&#146;s 2015 list of &#147;40 Best Companies for Diversity.&#148; It is our people &#151; our greatest asset &#151; that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 400,000 team members who are &#147;absolutely, positively&#148; focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare. For additional information on our people-first philosophy and workplace initiatives, see http://csr.fedex.com . 

Our Community 

FedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources and network. We provide financial contributions, in-kind charitable shipping services and volunteer efforts by our team members to help a variety of non-profit organizations achieve their goals and make a measurable impact on the world. We have the following five core giving pillars: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Delivering for Good : Using our global network to deliver resources where they are needed most in times of disaster and for special shipments. 

&#160; 

- 7 - 

&#149; &#160; Sustainable Transportation : Developing solutions that connect the world responsibly and resourcefully, especially in urban areas. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Employment Pathways : Giving a pathway to meaningful employment for underserved populations. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Road Safety : Protecting pedestrians and making roads safer worldwide. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Global Entrepreneurship : Advancing women and minority-owned small businesses and entrepreneurs around the world. 

In the midst of the European migrant crisis, FedEx worked with disaster relief agencies and committed approximately $1 million in cash and transportation support to deliver critical medical aid and supplies to refugees in Europe and Turkey. For additional information on our community involvement and disaster relief efforts, see http://csr.fedex.com . 

In 2016, FedEx announced that it will invest $200 million in more than 200 communities by 2020 through its global giving platform, FedEx Cares. FedEx also supports communities throughout the U.S. with an annual United Way employee giving campaign. Additionally, more than 17,000 FedEx team members volunteered nearly 55,000 hours of service during FedEx Cares Week, a period dedicated to service projects in 500 communities in the U.S. and other regions FedEx serves around the globe. 

Like our customers, many of our vendors are diverse businesses. For more than two decades, FedEx has supported small, women-owned and minority-owned businesses in our supply chain. Our Sourcing organization manages the enterprise-wide Supplier Diversity program, aligning efforts to increase our direct spend with diverse suppliers within our broader sourcing strategy. We work with regional and national diversity organizations to promote the growth of small and diverse businesses and to increase opportunities for FedEx to work with these enterprises. The Women&#146;s Business Enterprise National Council named FedEx as a 2015 Top Corporation Award winner. 

The Environment 

In furtherance of our commitment to protecting the environment, we initiated an effort to increase FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency 30% from a 2005 baseline by 2020, and in 2016, we announced that we had surpassed that goal . We also continue with our goal to reduce aircraft emissions intensity by 30% by 2020 on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis, a goal that we increased from 20% in 2012. We have also established a goal of obtaining 30% of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by the year 2030. These efforts help us continue to reduce our environmental footprint as evidenced in 2015 when we saved more than 100 million gallons of jet fuel at FedEx Express and avoided more than one million metric tons of carbon emissions &#151; all while our shipment volumes were up. 

We will continue to expand on-site renewable energy generation in our facilities where feasible. To meet our future operational needs, as discussed above, we are adding more fuel-efficient aircraft to our fleet. The use of newer and more fuel-efficient aircraft is reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increasing our jet fuel efficiency. We have an impressive global alternative fuel fleet with approximately 1,900 alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen fueled vehicles, among others. We operate 15 solar facilities around the world, which collectively avoided more than 4,600 metric tons of CO 2 e emissions in 2015. In addition, ten FedEx Express facilities in the U.S. have received certification in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED &#174; ), the U.S. Green Building Council&#146;s system for rating the environmental performance of buildings, and more are being reviewed for certification. FedEx Express has made LEED certification the standard for newly built U.S. facilities. In addition, the FedEx India headquarters and the FedEx Office headquarters each received LEED certification in 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

&#160; 

- 8 - 

We also continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of our packaging and copy and print services, and minimize waste generation through efforts that include recycling and the use of copy paper with recycled content, among other environmentally-responsible available choices. In 2015, 96% of paper purchased for use by FedEx Office was third-party-certified as responsibly sourced. We also use FedEx-branded cardboard packaging at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which is made from approximately 60% recycled content. One example of our environmentally-responsible activities is the Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council, a U.S. nonprofit organization that supports and recognizes sustainable procurement of which we are a founding member. We continue to support the Council, contributing to discussions on how to improve sustainable purchasing in the areas of transportation and fuels, fiber- and timber-based products and more. For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see http://csr.fedex.com . 

Governance 

FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance. The Board has taken significant steps to enhance its accountability to stockholders in recent years. For example, in March 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a proxy access bylaw that permits up to 20 stockholders owning 3% or more of FedEx&#146;s outstanding voting stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in FedEx&#146;s proxy materials directors constituting up to two individuals or 20% of the Board, whichever is greater, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our Bylaws. 

Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which apply to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our website at http://investors.fedex.com . We will post in the Governance &#38; Citizenship section of the Investor Relations page of our website information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is required. 

Business Segments 

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments: 

FedEx Express Group 

On May 25, 2016, we acquired TNT Express, a leading international express transportation, small-package ground delivery and freight transportation company. In 2017, TNT Express&#146;s results will be disclosed as reportable segment and combined with the FedEx Express reportable segment in a new reporting structure referred to as the FedEx Express Group. During the integration process, we anticipate these segments will each continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions. However, they are being combined for financial reporting discussion purposes into a collective business as a result of their management reporting structure. Furthermore, over time their operations will be integrated, therefore presenting a group view provides a basis for future year-over-year comparison purposes.

FedEx Express Segment 

FedEx Express

Services 

FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Overnight and deferred package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to nearly the entire U.S. population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight.

International Expansion 

In May 2016, we acquired TNT Express, which has express delivery operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific and South America. This acquisition expands our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, and will lower our costs to serve European markets by increasing density in our pickup-and-delivery operations and accelerate our global growth. We have begun the process of integrating TNT Express operations with the FedEx Express network, which will take several years to fully execute. 

In 2014 we made a strategic move in Southern Africa by acquiring the businesses operated by our service provider in the following seven countries: South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zambia. These acquisitions, along with our 2013 acquisitions of transportation companies in Poland, France and Brazil and our 2012 acquisition of a Mexican domestic express package delivery company, gives us more robust global transportation networks and added capabilities in important international markets. 

Since we began serving mainland China in 1984, we have expanded our service to cover more than 400 cities across the country and, in 2009, we began operations at our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China. Our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which opened in April 2014, serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S., and operates as an international gateway for customers in western Japan. Additionally, in October 2012, we announced plans to establish a new International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai. This new facility, with designated onsite customs clearance, will be located at Shanghai&#146;s Pudong International Airport and is slated for completion in early 2017. These hubs will allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets. 

To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements. 

U.S. Postal Service Agreement 

In 2013, FedEx Express entered into a new seven-year agreement with the USPS for the provision of domestic air transportation services to the USPS for its First Class, Priority and Express Mail that runs through September 2020. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS&#146;s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#147;Risk Factors&#148;). 

Pricing 

FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its services. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 4, 2016, FedEx Express implemented a 4.9% average list price increase for FedEx Express U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services. 

FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on a rounded average of a certain spot price for jet fuel. For example, the fuel surcharge for May 2016 was based on the average spot price for jet fuel published for March 2016. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the average spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points 

&#160; 

- 11 - 

may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and our fuel surcharge methodology. Effective November 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at FedEx Express. The weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates for the past three years was: 2016 &#151; 2%; 2015 &#151; 6%; and 2014 &#151; 9%. See the &#147;Fuel&#148; section of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition&#148;) for a description and discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results. 

Operations 

FedEx Express&#146;s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company&#146;s multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, Fort Worth and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago. 

Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Guangzhou, Cologne/Bonn and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Guangzhou, Paris, Cologne/Bonn and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami &#151; the Miami Gateway Hub &#151; serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets. 

Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station&#146;s service area. In some international areas, independent agents (&#147;Global Service Participants&#148;) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption &#147;FedEx Express Segment.&#148; 

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. and Canadian retail locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers and corporate or industrial parks. 

Fuel Supplies and Costs 

During 2016, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See &#147;FedEx Express &#151; Pricing.&#148; 

The following table sets forth FedEx Express&#146;s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years: 

&#160;

Fiscal Year 

&#160; Total Jet Fuel Cost (in millions) &#160; &#160; Percentage of Consolidated Revenues &#160; 2016

- 12 - 

Most of FedEx Express&#146;s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts. 

Competition 

As described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#147;Risk Factors&#148;), the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings. 

Competitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (&#147;UPS&#148;), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders and the USPS. FedEx Express&#146;s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, foreign postal authorities, freight forwarders, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. We also compete with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. Many of FedEx Express&#146;s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express. 

Employees 

David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2016, FedEx Express employed approximately 115,000 permanent full-time and approximately 53,000 permanent part-time employees, of which 13% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Express&#146;s international employees represent 37% of all employees. 

The pilots at FedEx Express, who represent a small number of our total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (&#147;ALPA&#148;) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on November 2, 2015. The collective bargaining agreement is scheduled to become amendable in November 2021, after a six-year term. In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain of FedEx Express&#146;s non-U.S. employees are unionized. 

Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of FedEx Express employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative of FedEx Express employees (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent. 

FedEx Trade Networks 

FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding. FedEx Trade Networks also provides international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, publishes customs duty and tax information for over 180 customs areas worldwide. Additionally, FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx Express at its major U.S. hub facilities. 

As trade throughout the world grows, so does the FedEx Trade Networks solutions portfolio. Value-added services of FedEx Trade Networks include 120 freight forwarding offices in 26 countries and Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks has approximately 5,100 employees and 136 offices in 120 service locations throughout North America and in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, India, Latin America and the Middle East. FedEx Trade Networks maintains a network of air and ocean freight-forwarding service providers and has entered into strategic alliances to provide services in certain countries in which it does not have owned offices.

TNT Express Segment 

Overview 

Recently acquired TNT Express is a leading international express transportation, small-package ground delivery and freight transportation company. TNT Express collects, transports and delivers documents, parcels and freight on a day-definite or time-definite basis. TNT Express services are primarily classified by the speed, distance, weight and size of consignments. Whereas the majority of its shipments are between businesses, TNT Express also offers business-to-consumer services to select key customers. TNT Express operates road transportation networks and delivers to over 200 countries. 

Services 

TNT Express provides two types of express services &#151; Express and Economy Express. The Express services are day-definite and delivered next-day or fastest-by-air for distances for which next-day is not possible. The Economy Express services are also day-definite and are delivered fastest-by-road, except for intercontinental deliveries which depend on air. For both Express and Economy Express services, TNT has time-definite options for customers requiring delivery before a certain time. TNT also provides specialized or extremely urgent deliveries which include products such as same-day, value-added and non-standard freight services. 

Pricing 

TNT Express periodically updates list prices for the majority of its services. In general, shipping rates are based on the selected service, destination zone, (volumetric) weight, and any ancillary service charge. TNT Express offers its customers discounted prices generally based on actual or potential volumes and/or revenue. 

TNT Express has an indexed fuel surcharge that varies by region or country and by product. The fuel surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based upon the price of a designated fuel type. Updated information on the fuel surcharge is available at tnt.com . 

If a customer has requirements that fall outside of TNT Express&#146;s standard service levels, but are acceptable under its standard operating procedures, TNT Express will provide the service with an additional charge to cover the additional costs incurred. For instance, collections and deliveries in certain remote and less accessible locations will incur an out-of-area charge. 

&#160; 

- 14 - 

Operations 

TNT Express has a worldwide presence with domestic, regional and intercontinental delivery. TNT Express&#146;s customers are primarily large companies and multinationals, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. The main industries served by TNT Express are industrial, automotive, high-tech and healthcare. 

Services are delivered through a combination of physical infrastructures such as hubs, depots and vehicles, and electronic infrastructures such as track-and-trace systems. TNT Express operates road networks in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and South America. TNT Express&#146;s unique European road network connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs and over 540 depots. TNT Express conducts its operations through a fleet of approximately 42,000 road pickup-and-delivery and linehaul vehicles. Principal competitors of TNT Express include DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France&#146;s La Poste&#146;s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities and freight forwarders. 

As a condition precedent to its acquisition by FedEx, TNT Express sold its two airlines, TNT Airways and Pan Air L&#237;neas A&#233;reas, to ASL Aviation Group, as European regulations prohibit foreign ownership of European-based airlines. TNT Express and ASL Aviation Group entered into a multi-year service agreement to operate flights for the FedEx-TNT Express combination. Per the terms of the service agreement, ASL Aviation Group intends to operate the airlines in a manner that will maintain contracts with former TNT Express partner airlines, contractors and suppliers. The airlines operate primarily out of TNT&#146;s central air hub in Liege, Belgium. 

As of May 31, 2016, TNT Express had approximately 55,000 employees, of which 99% are employed outside the U.S. TNT Express also relies upon subcontractors and agents to conduct its pickup-and-delivery and linehaul operations. David Binks is the President and Chief Executive Officer of TNT Express (he reports to the FedEx Express Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer). TNT Express&#146;s headquarters are located in Hoofddorp, The Netherlands. 

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground 

Overview 

By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. 

FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. FedEx Ground&#146;s ongoing network expansion program is substantially increasing the company&#146;s daily pickup capacity through the addition of new hubs featuring the latest automated sorting technology, the expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities. 

The company offers our FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential 

&#160; 

- 15 - 

shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee. On August 31, 2015, our FedEx SmartPost business was merged into FedEx Ground. The FedEx SmartPost service specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages using the USPS for final delivery to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S. and remains an important component of our FedEx Ground service offerings. 

Additionally, FedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. By signing up at fedex.com , customers can receive notification of FedEx Ground packages en route to their homes and can choose various delivery options. 

Pricing 

FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. As previously announced, on January 4, 2016, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery average list prices increased 4.9%. In addition, on November 2, 2015, FedEx Ground increased surcharges for shipments that exceed the published maximum weight or dimensional limits. 

FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for May 2016 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for March 2016. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. On November 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine the fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground. See the &#147;Fuel&#148; section of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition&#148;) for a description and discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results. 

Operations 

FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of 575 facilities, including 33 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with approximately 52,000 owner-operated vehicles and approximately 51,000 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx SmartPost Service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Delivery&#146;s operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies. 

Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website, fedex.com . For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see &#147;FedEx Services &#151; Customer-Driven Technology.&#148; 

&#160; 

- 16 - 

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. and Canadian retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at all FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S. 

As of May 31, 2016, FedEx Ground had approximately 81,000 employees. In addition, FedEx Ground relies on independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers. Henry J. Maier is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS, the USPS and regional delivery carriers. 

Independent Contractor Model 

FedEx Ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (such as state tax or other administrative challenges) where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue. During the third quarter of 2016, we reached agreements in principle to settle all of the 19 cases on appeal in the multidistrict litigation. These cases involve a contractor model which FedEx Ground has not operated since 2011. In addition, we are defending contractor-model cases that are not or are no longer part of the multidistrict litigation. These cases are in varying stages of litigation. We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in these proceedings and continue to believe that FedEx Ground&#146;s owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an employer of the drivers of the company&#146;s independent contractors. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#147;Risk Factors&#148;) and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

In the third quarter of 2016, FedEx Ground announced plans to implement the Independent Service Provider (&#147;ISP&#148;) agreement throughout its entire U.S. pickup and delivery network. To date, service providers in 24 states are operating under, or transitioning to, the ISP agreement. The transition to the ISP agreement in the remaining 26 states is expected to be completed by 2020. The costs associated with these transitions will be recognized in the periods incurred and are not expected to be material to any future quarter. 

GENCO 

On January 30, 2015, we acquired GENCO, a leading North American third-party logistics provider. With a comprehensive portfolio of supply chain services, GENCO&#146;s expertise will expand existing FedEx service offerings in the evolving retail and e-commerce markets. GENCO&#146;s infrastructure and supply chain capabilities include reverse logistics, providing triage, test and repair, remarketing and product liquidation solutions. Additionally, GENCO&#146;s breadth of expertise in targeted vertical markets &#151; such as technology, healthcare and retail &#151; aligns with our strategic priorities in these areas. With more than 11,000 employees at approximately 119 facilities, GENCO offers a complete range of product lifecycle logistics &#174; services to customers in the technology, consumer, industrial, retail, and healthcare markets. GENCO is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The financial results of this business are included in the FedEx Ground segment from the date of acquisition. GENCO has a small number of employees that are members of unions. 

FedEx Freight Segment 

FedEx Freight 

FedEx Freight is a leading U.S. provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers &#151; FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet supply chain needs, and FedEx Freight Economy, when time can be 

&#160; 

- 17 - 

traded for cost savings. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority, which has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service, offers a no-fee money-back guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between Canada and the U.S. In addition, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances. 

Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers&#146; time-critical needs with industry leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight, FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company&#146;s innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the internet, e-mail or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com , FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server and FedEx Web Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada, backed by a money-back guarantee. 

In 2016, FedEx Freight introduced the new FedEx Freight box, which makes transporting LTL shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and no freight classification. The FedEx Freight box comes in two sizes: a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The ability to choose between freight boxes makes freight shipping accessible to any business. With a distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx Freight box allows customers to ship LTL with flat rates. The FedEx Freight box was initially introduced into selected markets during the second half of 2016, and was subsequently rolled out to customers nationwide in June 2016. 

FedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge that applies to certain LTL shipments, which is subject to weekly adjustment based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel. On February 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine FedEx Freight fuel surcharges. On January 4, 2016, FedEx Freight implemented zone-based pricing on U.S. and other LTL shipping rates. Also, on January 4, 2016, FedEx Freight implemented a 4.9% average increase in certain U.S. and other shipping rates. 

As of May 31, 2016, the FedEx Freight segment was operating approximately 65,000 vehicles and trailers from a network of approximately 370 service centers and had approximately 40,000 employees. Michael L. Ducker is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight&#146;s primary competitors are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), XPO Logistics, Inc., UPS Freight, Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. and ABF Freight (a subsidiary of ArcBest Corporation). 

In 2014 and 2015, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (&#147;Teamsters&#148;) petitioned for National Labor Relations Board elections at sixteen FedEx Freight facilities. The Teamsters lost the vote or withdrew the petition prior to the election at twelve facilities and won the vote at four facilities. With respect to the elections that the Teamsters won, FedEx Freight appealed all four elections to federal appellate courts. Two of those appeals are still pending. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the election results in two of the locations, Charlotte, North Carolina and Croydon, Pennsylvania. We have begun bargaining with the unions in Charlotte and Croydon, but no substantive proposals have been exchanged between the parties. No new petitions for elections were filed in 2016.

Customer Driven Technology 

FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith&#146;s vision that &#147;the information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself&#148; remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. In fact, FedEx ranked No. 1 in the first-ever InformationWeek Elite 100 Decade Award category, recognizing the 10 companies that have ranked the highest on average in the InformationWeek Elite 100, a compilation of the top business technology innovators in the U.S., over the past 10 years.

The fedex.com website was launched over 20 years ago, and during that time, customers have shipped and tracked billions of packages at fedex.com . The fedex.com website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use and customer-focused features. At fedex.com , our customers ship packages, determine international documentation requirements, track package status, pay invoices and

FedEx also uses wireless data collection devices to scan bar codes on shipments, thereby enhancing and accelerating the package information available to our customers. 

FedEx continues to provide customers with innovative solutions. For example, in May 2014 FedEx TechConnect (now FedEx Services) opened a package laboratory providing FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight customers with free package testing and design services. 

We design our e-commerce tools and solutions to be easily integrated into our customers&#146; applications, as well as into third-party software developed by leading e-procurement, systems integration and enterprise resource planning companies. Our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes.

Global ISO 9001 Certification 

FedEx Services provides our customers with a high level of service quality, as evidenced by our ISO 9001 certification for our global express and ground operations. ISO 9001 registration is required by thousands of customers around the world. FedEx&#146;s global certification, encompassing the processes of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services, enhances our single-point-of-access strategy and solidifies our reputation as the quality leader in the transportation industry. ISO 9001 is currently the most rigorous international standard for Quality Management and Assurance. ISO standards were developed by the International Organization for Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland to promote and facilitate international trade. More than 150 countries, including European Union members, the U.S. and Japan, recognize ISO standards. 

FedEx Office 

FedEx Office&#146;s network of digitally-connected locations offers access to copying and digital printing through retail and web-based platforms, signs and graphics, professional finishing, computer rentals, and the full range of FedEx day-definite ground shipping and time-definite global express shipping services. FedEx Office&#146;s network of locations provides convenient access points to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services for higher margin retail customers. Customers may also have their FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery packages delivered to any FedEx Office location nationwide by choosing the &#147;Hold at FedEx Location&#148; option when initiating a shipment &#151; or even when a shipment is on its way &#151; free of charge. Additionally, FedEx SameDay City has expanded to include 24 markets across the U.S., which allows customers to get their packages across town in the same day with local delivery by FedEx Office uniformed team members in branded FedEx Office delivery vehicles. 

FedEx Office also offers packing services, and packing supplies and boxes are included in its retail offerings. By allowing customers to have items professionally packed by specially trained FedEx Office team members and then shipped using FedEx Ground day-definite shipping and time-definite global FedEx Express shipping services, FedEx Office offers a complete &#147;pack-and-ship&#148; solution. In November 2014, FedEx Office rolled out a new packing feature, Pack Plus, which expanded FedEx Office&#146;s packing and shipping capabilities. FedEx Pack Plus offerings include new custom box building capabilities and techniques, a more robust assortment of specialty boxes and additional packing supplies, equipment and tools to serve our customers&#146; needs. In May 2016, eBay and FedEx Office announced the eBay Valet Drop-Off Program to make it easier for consumers to sell items online. The eBay Valet Drop-Off Program will allow customers to bring in items to a FedEx Office location, where, backed by the FedEx Office Packing Pledge, a FedEx Office team member will pack and ship the item(s) to an eBay Valet processing center to be listed, sold and shipped to the buyer. Once the item(s) sells, the customer will receive payment via PayPal, and customers will receive updates and notifications throughout the selling process.

Almost all FedEx Office locations provide local pickup and delivery service for print jobs completed by FedEx Office. A FedEx courier picks up a customer&#146;s print job at the customer&#146;s location and then returns the finished product to the customer. Options and services vary by location. Additionally, through cloud printing with FedEx Office Print Online, customers can access files from some of the most popular cloud providers including Box, Dropbox, Google Drive&#153; and Microsoft OneDrive &#174; and then select from a variety of printing options. Customers can choose to pick up their completed order at FedEx Office locations nationwide or have the order delivered right to their door. Customers also have the ability to access these same cloud files through a USB drive or mobile device at self-serve copiers in FedEx Office locations, giving them seamless access to their files across our online and retail channels. 

In July 2015, FedEx Office launched a faster, cost-effective and streamlined way to deliver professional print services to large, commercial customers. Using an industry-leading software system, large or complex print jobs are directed to one of the FedEx Office centralized production centers. FedEx Office team members at the network fulfillment center then quickly view and assess the print production volume within the network, and direct print jobs to more than 100 color and monochrome digital presses across the country. The enhanced system then allows the FedEx Office network fulfillment center to manage the distribution of print jobs originating in one location to be sent for completion at production locations closer to the customer&#146;s point of need, leveraging the vast FedEx Office national network for centralized, regionalized and localized printing, based on distribution requirements. 

As of May 31, 2016, FedEx Office operated approximately 1,800 customer facing centers, including 25 locations in Canada, and also operated 33 centralized production centers. During 2016, FedEx Office relocated to its new corporate headquarters in Plano, Texas. 

Trademarks 

The &#147;FedEx&#148; trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx SupplyChain, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx Custom Critical, FedEx CrossBorder, GENCO and TNT Express, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation, or the respective companies, for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file, as applicable. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness. 

Regulation 

Air . Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;) and the Federal Aviation Administration (&#147;FAA&#148;) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express. 

The FAA&#146;s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations. 

&#160;

In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including FedEx Express, were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements, and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us. 

The DOT&#146;s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT&#146;s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. 

Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (&#147;TSA&#148;), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us. 

FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (&#147;CRAF&#148;) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express&#146;s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights. 

Ground . The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration. 

The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation. 

Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations. 

International . FedEx Express&#146;s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT&#146;s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient 

&#160;

manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments. 

Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express&#146;s growing international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. 

Communication . Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express&#146;s activities pertaining to satellite communications. 

Environmental . Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express&#146;s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express&#146;s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Express&#146;s significant markets. Congress&#146;s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express&#146;s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates. 

Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (&#147;GHG&#148;) emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a proposed finding on GHG emissions from aircraft and its relationships to air pollution. The final finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA&#146;s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions. Additionally, in 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (&#147;ETS&#148;) for GHG emissions, to the airline industry. Under this decision, all FedEx Express flights that are wholly within the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. For a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#147;Risk Factors&#148;). 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Office&#146;s copy machines. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations. 

Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions. 

&#160;

Labor. All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the &#147;RLA&#148;), while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the &#147;NLRA&#148;). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process. 

The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company in 1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network. 

The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these potential labor law changes, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#147;Risk Factors&#148;).
