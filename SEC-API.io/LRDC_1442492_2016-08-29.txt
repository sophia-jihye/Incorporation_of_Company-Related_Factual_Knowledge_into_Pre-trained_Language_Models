Summary 

&#160; 

Laredo Oil, Inc. (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) is a management services company managing the acquisition and conventional operation of mature oil fields and the further recovery of stranded oil from those fields using enhanced oil recovery (&#8220;EOR&#8221;) methods for its sole customer, Stranded Oil Resources Corporation (&#8220;SORC&#8221;), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation (&#8220;Alleghany&#8221;). 

&#160; 

From its inception through October 2009, the Company was primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for mineral properties. After a change in control in October 2009, the Company shifted its focus to locating mature oil fields with the intention of acquiring those oil fields and recovering stranded oil using EOR methods. The Company was unable to raise the capital required to purchase any suitable oil fields. On June 14, 2011, the Company entered into several agreements with SORC to seek recovery of stranded crude oil from mature, declining oil fields by using the EOR method known as Underground Gravity Drainage (&#8220;UGD&#8221;). Such agreements consist of a license agreement between the Company and SORC (the &#8220;SORC License Agreement&#8221;), a license agreement between the Company and Mark See, the Company&#8217;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) (the &#8220;MS-Company License Agreement&#8221;), an Additional Interests Grant Agreement between the Company and SORC, a Management Services Agreement between the Company and SORC (the &#8220;MSA&#8221;), a Finder&#8217;s Fee Agreement between the Company and SORC (the &#8220;Finder&#8217;s Fee Agreement&#8221;), and a Stockholders Agreement (the &#8220;Stockholders Agreement&#8221;) among the Company, SORC and Alleghany Capital Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alleghany (&#8220;Alleghany Capital&#8221;), each of which are dated June 14, 2011 (collectively, the &#8220;Agreements&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The Company and Mark See now provide to SORC both management services and expertise pursuant to the SORC License Agreement, MS-Company License Agreement and the MSA. As consideration for the licenses to SORC, the Company will receive a 19.49% interest in SORC net profits as defined in the SORC License Agreement (the &#8220;Royalty&#8221;). Under the SORC License Agreement, the Company agreed that a portion of the Royalty equal to at least 2.25% of the net profits (the &#8220;Incentive Royalty&#8221;) be used to fund a long term incentive plan for the benefit of its employees, as determined by the Company&#8217;s board of directors. On October 11, 2012, the Laredo Royalty Incentive Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) was approved and adopted by the Board and the Incentive Royalty was assigned by the Company to Laredo Royalty Incentive Plan, LLC, a special purpose Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Laredo Oil, Inc. formed to carry out the purposes of the Plan (the &#8220;Plan Entity&#8221;). As a result of the assignment of the Incentive Royalty to the Plan Entity, the Royalty retained by the Company has been reduced from 19.49% to 17.24% subject to reduction to 15% under certain events stipulated in the SORC License Agreement. Additionally, in the event of a SORC initial public offering or certain other defined corporate events, the Company will receive 17.24%, subject to reduction to 15% under the SORC License Agreement, of the SORC common equity or proceeds emanating from the event in exchange for termination of the Royalty. Under certain circumstances regarding termination of exclusivity and license terminations, the Royalty could be reduced to 7.25%. 

&#160; 

The MSA provides that the Company will provide the services of key employees (&#8220;Key Persons&#8221;), including Mark See, in exchange for monthly and quarterly management service fees. Mark See acts as the CEO of SORC pursuant to the MSA. He and other members of Company management spend substantially all of their time and effort in fulfilling the terms of the Agreements whereby they use their best efforts to evaluate, acquire, develop and recover crude oil from fields conducive to the UGD oil recovery method. The quarterly management services fee is $137,500 and the monthly management services fee is payment towards the salaries, benefit costs, and employment taxes specified for the Key Persons identified in the Agreements. In addition, SORC reimburses the Company for expenses incurred by Key Persons in connection with their rendition of services under the MSA. The Company may submit written requests to SORC for additional funding for payment of the Company&#8217;s operating costs and expenses which SORC, in its sole and absolute discretion, will determine whether or not to fund. To date, no requests for additional funding have been submitted by the Company to SORC. 

&#160; 

SORC is funded solely by Alleghany Capital in exchange for issuance by SORC of 12% Cumulative Preferred Stock. Prior to the Company receiving any cash distributions from SORC, all accrued dividends must be paid and preferred shares redeemed. As of May 31, 2016, SORC has received approximately $258.4 million in net funding from Alleghany Capital.

&#160; 

Under the Finder&#8217;s Fee Agreement, SORC agreed to provide funding for amounts payable to Sunrise Securities Corporation (&#8220;Sunrise&#8221;) for certain finder&#8217;s fees relating to Alleghany&#8217;s investment in SORC, which amounts shall not exceed $1,100,000 in the aggregate. During fiscal year 2015, cumulative fee payments to Sunrise reached $1,100,000, thus fulfilling the total amount due under the Finder&#8217;s Fee Agreement. 

&#160; 

Under the MS-Company License Agreement, Mark See granted the Company an exclusive license to use certain knowhow and expertise. The Stockholders Agreement, which shall not be effective unless and until the Royalty is converted into SORC common stock pursuant to the Agreements, provides, among other things, that the Company shall have certain registration rights with respect to the SORC common stock it acquires. 

&#160; 

The Agreements require the Company to maintain confidentiality of SORC confidential information, except to the extent such confidential information is required to be disclosed under applicable law, but such disclosure is expressly limited to the sole purpose of complying with such law and such disclosure is permitted only to the extent required by such law. 

&#160; 

The UGD method uses conventional mining processes to establish a drilling chamber underneath an existing oil field from where closely spaced wellbores are intended to be drilled up into the reservoir, using residual radial pressure and gravity to then drain the targeted reservoir through the wellbores. This method is applicable to mature oil fields that have very specific geological characteristics. The Company has done extensive research and has identified oil fields within the United States that it believes are qualified for UGD recovery methods. The Company continues to manage and support SORC&#8217;s efforts to pursue and recover stranded oil from selected mature fields chosen from this group which may be acquired by SORC in its sole and absolute discretion. 

&#160; 

We believe the costs of implementing the UGD method are significantly lower than those presently experienced by commonly used EOR methods. We also estimate that we can materially increase the field oil production rate from prior periods and, in some cases, recover amounts of oil equal to or greater than amounts previously recovered from the mature fields selected . 

&#160; 

Our shares are currently listed for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (&#8220;OTCBB&#8221;) under the symbol LRDC. As of the date of this report, there has been light to medium trading for our common stock and we cannot provide assurance that an active trading market for our securities will ever develop. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our operating results are largely dependent upon SORC&#8217;s net profits as defined in the SORC License Agreement. We believe that SORC will encounter competition from other oil companies in all areas of operation, including the acquisition of mature fields, and that such competitors may include large, well established companies with substantial capital resources. 

&#160; 

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers 

&#160; 

The Company is dependent upon maintaining the Agreements with SORC and Alleghany Capital for its funding and for access to SORC&#8217;s net profits as defined in the Agreements. 

&#160; 

Operating Hazards and Uninsured Risks 

&#160; 

Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. We believe that the cost and timing of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and that drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including low oil prices, title problems, reservoir characteristics, weather conditions, equipment failures, delays by project participants, compliance with governmental requirements, shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services and increases in the cost for such equipment and services. SORC&#8217;s future oil recovery activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure may result in cancellation of the Agreements and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

&#160; 

Operations that the Company will manage for SORC are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, encountering formations with abnormal pressures, blowouts, craterings, pipeline ruptures and spills, any of which can result in the loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury claims and other damage to SORC properties and those of others. The Company maintains insurance against some but not all of the risks described above. In particular, the insurance we maintain does not cover claims relating to failure of title to oil leases, loss of surface equipment at well locations, business interruption, loss of revenue due to low commodity prices or loss of revenues due to well failure. The occurrence of an event that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance which we maintain or which SORC may acquire, could have a material adverse effect on our Royalty in the period such event may occur.

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Oil and natural gas exploration, production, transportation and marketing activities are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations promulgated by federal and state legislatures and agencies, including but not limited to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;MSHA&#8221;), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;), the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;), and various state regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with such laws, rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties, including the delay or stopping of our operations. The legislative and regulatory burden on the oil industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our Royalty. 

&#160; 

State regulatory agencies, as well as the federal government when operating on federal or Indian lands, require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and also impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil. These governmental authorities also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. In each jurisdiction, we will most likely need exceptions to some regulations requiring regulatory approval. All of these matters could affect the Royalty. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

The oil industry is subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to both environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue. These laws and regulations may require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences, and for certain other activities, limit or prohibit access, seismic acquisition, construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas, impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations, and require the reclamation of certain lands. 

&#160; 

The permits that are required for oil and gas operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. 

&#160; 

Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill prevention, control countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. For onshore and offshore facilities that may affect waters of the United States, the OPA requires an operator to demonstrate financial responsibility. Regulations are currently being developed under federal and state laws concerning oil pollution prevention and other matters that may impose additional regulatory burdens on participants in the oil and gas industry. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require permits to be obtained to authorize discharge into surface waters or to construct facilities in wetland areas. The Clean Air Act of 1970 and its subsequent amendments in 1990 and 1997 also impose permit requirements and necessitate certain restrictions on point source emissions of volatile organic carbons (nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide) and particulates with respect to certain of our operations. The EPA and designated state agencies have in place regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff and stationary sources of air emissions. These programs require covered facilities to obtain individual permits, participate in a group or seek coverage under an EPA general permit. Most agencies recognize the unique qualities of oil and natural gas exploration and production operations. A number of agencies including but not limited to MSHA, the EPA, the BLM, and similar state commissions have adopted regulatory guidance in consideration of the operational limitations on these types of facilities and their potential to emit pollutants. 

&#160;
