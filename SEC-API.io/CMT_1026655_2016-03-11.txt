 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS OF CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 

In 1996, RYMAC Mortgage Investment Corporation (&#8220;RYMAC&#8221;) incorporated Core Molding Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Core Molding Technologies&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), formerly known as Core Materials Corporation before changing its name on August 28, 2002, for the purpose of acquiring the Columbus Plastics unit of Navistar, Inc. (&#8220;Navistar&#8221;), formerly known as International Truck &#38; Engine Corporation. On December 31, 1996, RYMAC merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity. Immediately after the merger, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and liabilities of the Columbus Plastics unit from Navistar in return for a secured note, which has been repaid, and 4,264,000 shares of newly issued common stock of the Company. On July 18, 2007, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with Navistar, pursuant to which the Company repurchased 3,600,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, from Navistar. On August 16, 2013, Navistar sold its remaining 664,000 shares of common stock in a series of open market sales. 

In 1998, the Company opened a second compression molding plant located in Gaffney, South Carolina as part of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy to expand its customer base. This facility provided the Company with additional capacity and a strategic location to serve both current and prospective customers. 

In October 2001, the Company incorporated Core Composites Corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary under the laws of the State of Delaware. This entity was established for the purpose of holding and establishing operations for Airshield Corporation&#8217;s assets, which the Company acquired on October 16, 2001 (the &#8220;Airshield Asset Acquisition&#8221;) as part of the Company&#8217;s diversified growth strategy. Airshield Corporation was a privately held manufacturer and marketer of fiberglass reinforced plastic parts primarily for the truck and automotive aftermarket industries. The Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Airshield Corporation through the United States Bankruptcy Court as Airshield Corporation had been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 2001. 

In conjunction with establishment of operations for the assets acquired in the Airshield Asset Acquisition, the Company established a Mexican subsidiary and leased a production facility in Mexico. In October 2001, the Company (5% owner) and Core Composites Corporation (95% owner) incorporated Corecomposites de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (&#8220;Corecomposites&#8221;) in Matamoros, Mexico. Corecomposites was organized to operate under a maquiladora program whereby substantially all products produced are exported back to Core Composites Corporation which sells such products to United States based external customers. In June of 2009, the Company completed construction and took occupancy of a new production facility in Matamoros, Mexico that replaced its leased facility. 

In September 2004, the Company formed Core Automotive Technologies, LLC (&#8220;Core Automotive&#8221;), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. This entity was formed for the purpose of establishing operations and holding assets acquired from Keystone Restyling, Inc., which the Company acquired as part of its diversified growth strategy in September, 2004. Keystone Restyling, Inc. was a privately held manufacturer and marketer of fiberglass reinforced plastic parts primarily for the automotive and light truck aftermarket industries. The Company&#8217;s facility in Matamoros, Mexico provides manufacturing services for Core Automotive Technologies. 

In August 2005, the Company formed Core Composites Cincinnati, LLC, ("Core Composites Cincinnati") a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. This entity was formed for the purpose of establishing operations and holding assets acquired from the Cincinnati Fiberglass Division of Diversified Glass Inc., which the Company acquired in August, 2005. The Cincinnati Fiberglass Division of Diversified Glass, Inc. was a privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced plastic components supplied primarily to the heavy-duty truck market. As a result of this acquisition, the Company leases a manufacturing facility in Batavia, Ohio. 

In March 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of CPI Binani, Inc., a Minnesota based manufacturer and producer of direct long fiber thermoplastic ("D-LFT") products, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Binani Industries Limited, located in Winona, Minnesota ("CPI"). The purpose of the acquisition was to increase the Company's process capabilities and diversify the Company's customer base.

Core Molding Technologies and its subsidiaries operate in the plastics market in a family of products known as &#8220;reinforced plastics.&#8221; Reinforced plastics are combinations of resins and reinforcing fibers (typically glass or carbon) that are molded to shape. Core Molding Technologies is a manufacturer of sheet molding compound ("SMC") and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics. The Company specializes in large-format moldings and offers a wide range of fiberglass processes, including compression molding of SMC, glass mat thermoplastics ("GMT"), bulk molding compounds ("BMC") and D-LFT; spray-up, hand-lay-up, and resin transfer molding ("RTM"). Additionally, the Company offers reaction injection molding ("RIM"), utilizing dicyclopentadiene technology. 

Reinforced plastics compete largely against metals and have the strength to function well during prolonged use. Management believes that reinforced plastic components offer many advantages over metals, including: 

&#8226; heat resistance; 

&#8226; corrosion resistance; 

&#8226; lighter weight; 

&#8226; lower cost; 

&#8226; greater flexibility in product design; 

&#8226; part consolidation for multiple piece assemblies; 

&#8226; lower initial tooling costs for lower volume applications; 

&#8226; high strength-to-weight ratio; and 

&#8226; dent-resistance in comparison to steel or aluminum. 

The largest markets for reinforced plastics are transportation (automotive and truck), agriculture, construction, marine, and industrial applications. The Company currently operates five production facilities in Columbus, Ohio; Batavia, Ohio; Gaffney, South Carolina; Winona, Minnesota; and Matamoros, Mexico, which produce reinforced plastic products. Our manufacturing facilities utilize various production processes; however, end products are similar and are not unique to a facility or customer base. Operating decision makers (officers of the Company) are headquartered in Columbus, Ohio and oversee all manufacturing 

&#32;4 

operations for all products as well as oversee customer relationships with all customers. The Company supplies reinforced plastic products to truck manufacturers, automotive suppliers, and manufacturers of marine and other commercial products. In general, product growth and diversification are achieved in several different ways: (1) resourcing of existing reinforced plastic product from another supplier by an original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;); (2) obtaining new reinforced plastic products through a selection process in which an OEM solicits bids; (3) successful marketing of reinforced plastic products for previously non-reinforced plastic applications; (4) successful marketing of reinforced plastic products to OEMs outside of our traditional markets; (5) development of new materials, technology and processes to meet current or prospective customer requirements; and (6) acquiring an existing business. The Company's efforts continue to be directed towards all six areas. 

MAJOR COMPETITORS 

The Company believes that it is one of the three largest compounders and molders of reinforced plastics using the SMC, spray-up, hand-lay-up, RTM, and D-LFT molding processes in North America. The Company faces competition from a number of other molders including, most significantly, Molded Fiber Glass Companies, Continental Structural Plastics, Ashley Industrial Molding, Sigma Industries and The Composites Group. The Company believes that it is well positioned to compete based primarily on manufacturing capability and location, product quality, engineering capability, cost, and delivery. However, the industry remains highly competitive and some of the Company's competitors have greater financial resources, research and development facilities, design engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities. 

MAJOR CUSTOMERS 

The Company had four major customers, Navistar, Volvo Group ("Volvo"), PACCAR Inc. ("PACCAR") and Yamaha Motor Manufacturing Corporation of America ("Yamaha"), in 2015 . Major customers are defined as customers whose current year sales individually consist of more than ten percent of total sales during any annual or interim reporting period in the current year. The loss of a significant portion of sales to Navistar, Volvo, PACCAR, or Yamaha would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. 

The North American truck market in which Navistar, Volvo, and PACCAR compete is highly competitive and the demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks is subject to considerable volatility as it moves in response to cycles in the overall business environment and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector, which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled. Truck demand also depends on general economic conditions, among other factors. 

Yamaha Motor Manufacturing Corporation of America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Yamaha Motor Corporation, U.S.A., is a top manufacturer of recreational vehicles including golf carts, all-terrain vehicles, personal watercraft and side by side utility vehicles. Demand in the recreational vehicle market is typically influenced by the rapid introduction of new models creating a short product lifecycle, the brand recognition of the various competitors, general economic conditions, and seasonal effects, among other factors. 

Relationship with Navistar 

The Company has historically had a Comprehensive Supply Agreement with Navistar that provides for the Company to be the primary supplier of Navistar&#8217;s original equipment and service requirements for fiberglass reinforced parts, as long as the Company remains competitive in cost, quality, and delivery.

PRODUCTS 

Sheet Molding Compound (&#8220;SMC&#8221;) 

SMC is primarily a combination of resins, fiberglass, fillers, and catalysts compounded and cured in sheet form, which is then used to manufacture compression-molded products, as discussed below. The Company also sells SMC to other molders. 

The Company incorporates a sophisticated computer program in the process of compounding various complex SMC formulations tailored to meet customer needs. The program provides for the control of information during various production processes and data for statistical batch controls. 

Closed Molded Products 

The Company manufactures plastic products using compression molding, resin transfer molding and reaction injection molding. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company owned 50 molding presses in its Columbus, Ohio facility (16), Matamoros, Mexico 

&#32;6 

facility (19), Gaffney, South Carolina facility (10) and Winona, Minnesota facility (5). The Company's molding presses range in size from 250 to 5,000 tons. 

Compression Molding of SMC - Compression molding is a process whereby SMC is molded to form by matched die steel molds through which a combination of heat and pressure are applied via a molding press. This process produces high quality, dimensionally consistent products. This process is typically used for high volume products. Higher volumes justify the customer's investment in matched die steel molds. 

Large platen, high tonnage presses (2,000 tons or greater) provide the ability to mold very large reinforced plastic parts. The Company believes that it possesses a significant portion of the large platen, high tonnage molding capacity in the industry. To enhance the surface quality and the paint finish of our products, the Company uses both in-mold coating and vacuum molding processes. 

In-mold coating is the process of injecting a liquid over the molded part surface and then applying pressure at elevated temperatures during an extended molding cycle. The liquid coating serves to fill and/or bridge surface porosity as well as provide a barrier against solvent penetration during subsequent top-coating operations. 

Vacuum molding is the removal of air during the molding cycle for the purpose of reducing the amount of surface porosity. The Company believes that it is among the industry leaders in in-mold coating and vacuum molding applications, based on the size and complexity of parts molded. 

Resin Transfer Molding (&#8220;RTM&#8221;) - This process employs two molds, typically a core and a cavity, similar to matched die molding. The composite is produced by placing glass mat, chopped strand, or continuous strand fiberglass in the mold cavity in the desired pattern. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface. The core mold is then fitted to the cavity, and upon a satisfactory seal, a vacuum is applied. When the proper vacuum is achieved, the resin is injected into the mold to fill the part. Finally, the part is allowed to cure and is then removed from the mold and trimmed to shape. Fiberglass reinforced products produced from the RTM process exhibit a high quality surface on both sides of the part and excellent part thickness. The multiple insert tooling technique can be utilized in the RTM process to improve throughput based upon volume requirements. 

Direct Long-Fiber Thermoplastics ("D-LFT") - &#32;D-LFT molding employs two molds, typically a core and a cavity, similar to matched die molding. This is a process for compounding and molding thermoplastic materials with "long" fibers (typically, 0.5 inch or longer). Engineered thermoplastic pellets and performance additives are compounded in a screw extruder, to which chopped reinforcements (typically, glass fibers) are added and further extruded. A "charge" of material is cut to a precise weight, and this "charge" is directly moved to a compression or injection-transfer process, where it is molded into a finished part. The process allows for direct processing of the compounded material, bypassing the expense and delay of producing an intermediate product (pellets or sheets) as is used in other fiber-reinforced thermoplastic molding processes. The D-LFT process is an attractive option for products that have complex geometry, require high strength and stiffness and benefit from the recyclability of a thermoplastic resin. 

Reaction Injection Molding (&#8220;RIM&#8221;) - This is a process whereby a composite is produced through the injection of a two-component thermoset resin system utilizing dicyclopentadiene (&#8220;DCPD&#8221;) technology. DCPD technology involves injecting a liquid compound into matched die aluminum molds to form the part. In this process the mold is prepared, closed and the liquid compound is injected into the tool then cured. Additional finishing is required when the part is designated for top coat painting. The RIM process is an alternative to other closed mold processes for mid-volume parts that require a high level of impact resistance. 

Open Molded Products 

The Company produces reinforced plastic products using both the hand lay-up and spray-up methods of open molding at our Batavia, Ohio and Matamoros, Mexico locations. Part sizes weigh from a few pounds to several hundred pounds with surface quality tailored for the end use application. 

Hand Lay-Up - This process utilizes a shell mold, typically the cavity, where glass cloth, either chopped strand or continuous strand glass mat, is introduced into the cavity. Resin is then applied to the cloth and rolled out to achieve a uniform wet-out from the glass and to remove any trapped air. The part is then allowed to cure and removed from the mold. After removal, the part typically undergoes trimming to achieve the shape desired. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface prior to the lay-up to improve the surface quality of the finished part. Parts produced from this process have a smooth outer surface and an unfinished or rough interior surface. These fiberglass-reinforced products are typically non-cosmetic components or structural reinforcements that are sold externally or used internally as components of larger assemblies. 

&#32;7 

Spray-Up - This process utilizes the same type of shell mold as hand-lay-up, but instead of using glass cloth to produce the composite part, a chopper/spray system is employed. Glass rovings and resin feed the chopper/spray gun. The resin coated, chopped glass is sprayed into the mold to the desired thickness. The resin coated glass in the mold is then rolled out to ensure complete wet-out and to remove any trapped air. The part is then allowed to cure, is removed from the mold and is then trimmed to the desired shape. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface prior to the resin-coated glass being sprayed into the mold to improve the surface quality of the finished part. Parts produced from this process have a smooth outer surface and an unfinished or rough interior surface. 

Assembly, Machining, and Paint Products 

Many of the products molded by the Company are assembled, machined and prime painted or topcoat painted to result in a completed product used by the Company's customers. 

The Company has demonstrated manufacturing flexibility that accommodates a range of low volume hand assembly and machining work, to high volume, highly automated assembly and machining systems. Robotics are used as deemed productive for material 

handling, machining, and adhesive applications. In addition to conventional machining methods, water-jet cutting technology is also used where appropriate. The Company also utilizes paint booths and batch ovens in its facilities. The Company generally contracts with outside providers for higher volume applications that require top coat paint. 

RAW MATERIALS 

The principal raw materials used in the Company's processes are unsaturated polyester, vinyl ester, epoxy, polypropylene and dicyclopentadiene resins, fiberglass, and filler. Other significant raw materials include adhesives for assembly of molded components, in-mold coating, gel-coat, prime paint for preparation of cosmetic surfaces, and hardware (primarily metal components). Many of the raw materials used by the Company are crude oil based, natural gas based and downstream components, and therefore, the costs of certain raw materials can be affected by changes in costs of these underlying commodities. Due to fluctuating commodity prices, suppliers are typically reluctant to enter into long-term contracts. The Company generally has supplier alternatives for each raw material, and regularly evaluates its supplier base for certain supplies, repair items, and components to improve its overall purchasing position. 

BACKLOG 

The Company relies on production schedules provided by its customers to plan and implement production. These schedules are normally provided on a weekly basis and typically considered firm for approximately four weeks. Some customers update these schedules daily for changes in demand, allowing them to run their inventories on a &#8220;just&#8209;in&#8209;time&#8221; basis. The ordered backlog of four weeks of expected shipments, was approximately $13.1 million (all of which the Company shipped during the first quarter of 2016 ) and $15.6 million at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

&#160; 

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS 

Capacity utilization is measured based on a standard work week of five days per week, three-shifts per day. During times when demand exceeds a five day, three-shift capacity, the Company will work weekends to create additional capacity, which can provide capacity utilization percentages greater than 100%. 

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company put into service a second SMC production line, which approximately doubled SMC historical production capacity. The approximate SMC production line capacity utilization was 71% and 100% for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

The Company measures facility capacity in terms of its large molding presses (2,000 tons or greater) for the Columbus, Ohio, Gaffney, South Carolina, Winona, Minnesota and the SMC molding at the Matamoros, Mexico facility. 

The Company owned 27 large molding presses at December 31, 2015 . The combined approximate large press capacity utilization in these production facilities was 84% and 79% for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The increased utilization mainly resulted from increase in demand from Volvo, partially offset by increased capacity provided by three new large molding presses acquired in the Company's purchase of CPI in the first quarter of 2015. 

&#160; 

The capacity of production in the Batavia, Ohio facility and the spray-up, hand-lay-up and RTM at the Matamoros, Mexico facility are not linked directly to equipment capacities, due to the nature of the products produced. Capacity of these operations is tied to 

&#32;8 

available floor space. The approximate capacity utilization for these operations was 46% and 49% for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

The Company has been required at times to run up to a three shift/seven day operation to meet its customers' production requirements. The Company has used various methods from overtime to a weekend manpower crew to support the customers' production requirements. Based on industry analysts' forecasts for medium and heavy-duty truck production levels, recent and forecasted customer requirements, the Company anticipates running a three shift/seven day schedule, from time to time, to meet customer production requirements in 2016 . 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Capital expenditures totaled approximately $ 5.7 &#32;million, $10.7 million &#32;and $9.3 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;respectively. These capital expenditures primarily consisted of building improvements, compression molding presses, a new SMC production line and purchases of production equipment to manufacture parts. 

The Company continuously engages in product development. Research and development activities focus on developing new material formulations, new structural plastic products, new production capabilities and processes, and improving existing products and manufacturing processes. The Company does not maintain a separate research and development organization or facility, but uses its production equipment, as necessary, to support these efforts and cooperates with its customers and its suppliers in research and development efforts. Likewise, manpower to direct and advance research and development is integrated with the existing manufacturing, engineering, production, and quality organizations. Management of the Company has estimated that costs related to research and development were approximately $ 719,000 , $475,000 &#32;and $466,000 &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

The Company's manufacturing operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous pollutants into the air and waterways. The Company has established and implemented standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The Company's policy is to conduct its business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. The Company's environmental waste management process involves the regular auditing of hazardous waste accumulation points, hazardous waste activities and authorized treatment, storage and disposal facilities. As part of the Company's environmental policy, all manufacturing employees are trained on waste management and other environmental issues. 

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has issued Core Molding Technologies Title V Operating Permits for its Columbus, Ohio facility and its Batavia, Ohio facility. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control has issued a Title V Operating Permit for the Gaffney, South Carolina facility. Core Molding Technologies has substantially complied with these and all other environmental compliance permits at its U.S. production facilities. 

The Company holds various environmental operating permits for its production facility in Matamoros, Mexico as required by U.S. and Mexican state and federal regulations. The Company has substantially complied with all requirements of these operating permits. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company employed a total of 1,525 &#32;employees, which consists of 685 &#32;employees in its United States operations and 840 &#32;employees in its Mexico operations. Of these 1,525 &#32;employees, 293 &#32;employees at the Company's Columbus, Ohio facility are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (&#8220;IAM&#8221;), which extends to August 7, 2016, and 731 &#32;employees at the Company's Matamoros, Mexico facility are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Sindicato de Jorneleros y Obreros, which extends to January 16, 2017. 

PATENTS, TRADE NAMES, AND TRADEMARKS 

The Company will evaluate, apply for, and maintain patents, trade names, and trademarks where it believes that such patents, trade names, and trademarks are reasonably required to protect its rights in its products. The Company has increased its activity related to trademark protection in recent years, including the federal registration of the trademarks N-sulGuard&#174;, Featherlite&#174;, Airilite&#174;, FeatherliteXL&#174; and Econolite&#174;. However, the Company does not believe that any single patent, trade name, or trademark or related group of such rights is materially important to its business or its ability to compete. 

&#32;9 

SEASONALITY &#38; BUSINESS CYCLE 

The Company's business is affected annually by the production schedules of its customers. Certain of the Company's customers typically shut down their operations on an annual basis for a period of one to several weeks during the Company's third quarter. Certain customers also typically shut down their operations during the last week of December. As a result, demand for the Company's products typically decreases during the third and fourth quarters. Demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks, marine, and automotive products also fluctuate on an economic, cyclical and seasonal basis, causing a corresponding fluctuation for demand of the Company's products.
