Our Strategy and Business Segments 

Our business is organized around three distinct sets of solutions -- Small and Medium Business Solutions (SMB), Enterprise Business Solutions and Digital Commerce Solutions (DCS). 

Small and Medium Business Solutions 

We are a global leader in providing a full range of equipment, software, supplies and services that enable our clients to efficiently create physical and digital mail and evidence postage for the sending of mail, flats and parcels. We segment the SMB Solutions group between our North America operations, comprising the U.S. and Canadian businesses, and our International operations, comprising all other SMB businesses globally. We are a leading provider of mailing systems globally with about 900,000 meters installed in our North America operations and over 300,000 meters installed elsewhere. This business is characterized by a high level of recurring revenue driven by rental, lease and loan arrangements, contract support services and supplies sales. 

Enterprise Business Solutions 

Our Enterprise Business Solutions group includes equipment and services that enable large enterprises to process inbound and outbound mail. The Enterprise Business Solutions group includes our Production Mail operations and Presort Services operations. 

Production Mail 

Our product and service offerings enable clients to integrate all areas of print and mail into an end-to-end production environment from message creation to dispatch while realizing cost savings on postage. The core products within this segment include high-speed, high-volume inserting equipment, customized sortation products for mail and parcels and high-speed digital color printing systems that create high-value, relevant and timely communications targeted to our clients' customers. Beginning in 2016, we will offer new services and technical innovations including cloud connectivity for machines. 

Presort Services 

We are a national outsource provider of mail presort services for first-class, standard-class and flat mail in the U.S. and a workshare partner of the United States Postal Service (USPS). Our Presort Services network and fully-customized proprietary technology provides our clients with end-to-end solutions from pick up at their location to delivery into the postal system network. We process approximately 15 billion pieces of mail annually and are able to expedite mail delivery and optimize postage savings for our clients. 

Digital Commerce Solutions 

Within the Digital Commerce Solutions group, we provide a broad range of solutions, including customer information management, location intelligence and customer engagement software and shipping management and cross border ecommerce solutions for businesses of all sizes. These solutions are primarily delivered as traditional software licenses, enterprise platforms, software-as-a-service (SaaS) and on-demand applications. Our Digital Commerce Solutions group includes Software Solutions and Global Ecommerce. 

Software Solutions 

Customer information management solutions help businesses harness and deliver a deep and broad understanding of their customers and their context, such as location, relationships, propensity, sentiment and influence. The trusted data and associated insights allow our clients to deliver a personalized customer experience across multiple channels, manage risk and compliance, and improve sales, marketing and service effectiveness. We are one of the market leaders in the data quality segment. Large corporations and government agencies rely on our products in complex, high-volume, transactional environments to support their business processes. 

Location intelligence solutions enable our clients to organize and understand the complex relationships between location, geographic and other forms of data to drive business decisions and customer experiences. Our location intelligence solutions use predictive analytics, location, geographic and socio-demographic characteristics, which enable our clients to harness the power of location to better serve their customers, solve business problems, deliver location-based services and ultimately drive business growth. 

Customer engagement solutions provide clients with insight and understanding into customer behavior and interactions across the entire customer lifecycle, enabling them to orchestrate impactful, relevant and timely physical and digital interactions. When coupled with our inserting, sortation and digital print products, we are able to provide clients an all-inclusive solution that enables them to create, print and distribute wide-spread targeted customer communications. Our customer engagement solutions enable our clients to create connected experiences that positively influence future consumer behavior and generate business growth. 

Global Ecommerce 

Global Ecommerce includes our cross-border ecommerce solutions and shipping management solutions. Our cross-border ecommerce technology and services platforms enable retailers to transact with consumers globally. With our proprietary technology, we are able to manage all aspects of the international shopping and shipping experience, including multi-currency pricing, payment processing, fraud management, calculation of fully landed costs by quoting duty, taxes and shipping at checkout, compliance with product restrictions, export complexities and documentation requirements for customs clearance and brokerage and global logistics services. Our cross-border ecommerce software platforms are currently utilized by over 250 direct merchants as well as a major online marketplace enabling millions of parcels to be shipped to over 200 countries and territories worldwide. In 2015, we expanded our cross-border ecommerce capabilities through the acquisition of Borderfree, Inc. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Shipping management solutions enable clients to reduce transportation and logistics costs, select the best carrier based on need and cost, improve delivery times and track packages in real-time. We also offer scalable global logistics management systems that can be integrated into mail centers for the office and retail markets, as well as desktop and production shipping environments. 

See Item 7, "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment and geographic information. 

Client Service 

We have a client care service organization that provides telephone, online and on-site support to diagnose and repair our increasingly complex mailing equipment, production printers and sophisticated software solutions. Most of our support services are provided under annual contracts. 

Sales and Marketing 

We market our products and services through a direct and inside sales force, direct mailings, telemarketing, independent dealers and distributors and web channels. We sell to a variety of business, governmental, institutional and other organizations, and in our Ecommerce business only, we also sell to consumers as well as a variety of businesses. We have a broad base of clients and are not dependent upon any one client or type of client for a significant part of our total revenue. 

In 2014, we began a phased roll-out in our SMB Solutions operations of a strategy designed to provide clients broader access to products and services, improve the sales process and reduce costs by shifting more of our client coverage from field sales to inside sales. During 2015, we successfully rolled out this strategy worldwide and in 2016, we will begin shifting more client coverage activity to web channels. 

&#160; 

We have made, and are continuing to make, significant investments in the rebranding of the company. These investments include marketing and advertising spending designed to build market awareness and client demand for our products and services, and enhance our operational and go-to-market changes, including how we sell to and service clients. 

Competition 

All of our businesses face competition from a number of companies. Our competitors range from large, multinational companies that compete against many of our businesses to smaller, more narrowly focused regional and local firms. We compete on the basis of technology and innovation; breadth of product offerings; our ability to design and tailor solutions to specific client needs; performance; client service and support; price; quality and brand. 

We must continue to invest in our current technologies, products and solutions, and in the development of new technologies, products and solutions in order to maintain and improve our competitive position. We will encounter new competitors as we transition to higher value markets and offerings and enter new markets. 

A summary of the competitive environment for each of our business segments is as follows: 

North America Mailing and International Mailing 

We face significant competition from other mail equipment and software companies, companies that offer products and services as alternative means of message communications and non-traditional competitors that offer shipping and mailing products and services through online solutions. The principal competitive factors include the composition of offerings between software and hardware solutions, pricing, available financing and payment offerings, product reliability, support services, industry knowledge and expertise and attractiveness of alternative communication methods. Our competitive advantage includes our breadth of physical and web-based digital offerings, customer service and our extensive knowledge of the shipping and mailing industry. 

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, The Pitney Bowes Bank (the Bank), we offer a revolving credit solution to our SMB clients in the United States that enables them to pay for postage, the rental of certain mailing equipment and purchase products, supplies and services. The Bank also provides an interest-bearing deposit solution to those clients in the United States who prefer to prepay postage. We also provide similar revolving credit solutions to our clients in Canada and the U.K but do not offer these through the Bank in overseas markets. Our financing operations face competition, in varying degrees, from large, diversified financial institutions, including leasing companies, commercial finance companies and commercial banks, as well as small, specialized firms. Not all our competitors are able to offer these financing and payment solutions to their customers and we believe these solutions differentiate us from our competitors and are a source of competitive advantage. The Bank is chartered as an Industrial Bank under the laws of the State of Utah, and regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. 

Production Mail 

We face competition from other companies that offer large production printers, inserters or sorters. We also face competition from the fact that some companies choose to outsource although those outsource providers can also be our customers. Our competitive advantage lies in our ability to offer all of these products and services and integrate them into an end-to-end solution. The principal competitive factors include functionality, reliability, productivity, price and support. 

Presort Services 

We face competition from regional and local presort providers, service bureaus that offer presort solutions as part of a larger bundle of outsourcing services and large entities that have the capability to presort their own mailings in-house. The principal competitive factors include innovative service, delivery speed, industry expertise and economies of scale. Our competitive advantage includes our extensive network of presort facilities capable of processing significant volumes of mail and our innovative and proprietary technology that enables us to provide our clients with reliable and accurate services at maximum discounts. 

Software Solutions 

We operate in several highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets and face competition ranging from large global companies that offer a broad suite of solutions to smaller, more narrowly-focused companies that can design very targeted solutions. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality and ease of integration and use, scalability, innovation, support services and price. We compete based on the accuracy and processing speed of our solutions, particularly those used in our location intelligence solutions, the breadth and scalability of our products and solutions, our geocoding and reverse geocoding capabilities, and our ability to identify rapidly changing customer needs and develop technologies and solutions to meet these changing needs. 

Global Ecommerce 

The market for international ecommerce software and fulfillment services is highly fragmented, and includes competitors of various sizes, including companies with greater financial resources than us, some that specialize in point solutions or freight forwarding services, full-service ecommerce business process outsourcers and online marketplaces with international logistic support. In addition, major global delivery services companies are acquiring the technology to improve their cross border ecommerce shipping capabilities. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality and ease of integration and use, scalability, innovation, support services and price. We compete based on the accuracy, reliability and scalability of our platform, and our ability to provide our clients and their customers a one-stop full-service cross border ecommerce experience. 

Financing Solutions 

We offer a variety of finance and payment solutions to clients to finance their equipment and product purchases, rental and lease payments, postage replenishment and supplies purchases. We establish credit approval limits and procedures based on the credit quality of the client and the type of product or service provided to control risk in extending credit to clients. In addition, we utilize a systematic decision program for certain leases. This program is designed to facilitate low dollar transactions by utilizing historical payment patterns and losses realized for clients with common credit characteristics. The program defines the criteria under which we will accept a client without performing a more detailed credit investigation, such as maximum equipment cost, a client's time in business and payment experience. 

We closely monitor the portfolio by analyzing industry sectors and delinquency trends by product line, industry and client to ensure reserve levels and credit policies reflect current trends. Management continues to closely monitor credit lines and collection resources and revise credit policies as necessary to be more selective in managing the portfolio. 

&#160; 

Research, Development and Intellectual Property 

We invest in research and development programs to develop new products and solutions, enhance the effectiveness and functionality of existing products and solutions and deliver high value technology, innovative software and differentiated services in high value segments of the market. As a result of our research and development efforts, we have been awarded a number of patents with respect to several of our existing and planned products. However, our businesses are not materially dependent on any one patent or license or group of related patents or licenses. Research and development expenditures were $110 million , in each of 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Material Suppliers 

We depend on third-party suppliers for a variety of services, components, supplies and a large portion of our product manufacturing. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers around the world because the relationship is advantageous due to quality, price, or there are no alternative sources. We have not historically experienced shortages in services, components or products and believe that our available sources for materials, components, services and supplies are adequate. 

Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to the regulations of postal authorities worldwide related to product specifications and business practices involving our postage meters. We are further subject to the regulations of the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC with respect to the operations of the Bank and certain company affiliates that provide services to the Bank. We are also subject to the regulations of transportation, customs and other trade authorities worldwide related to the cross-border shipment of equipment, materials and parcels. In addition, we are subject to regulations worldwide concerning data privacy and security for our businesses that use, process and store certain personal, confidential or proprietary data. 

Employees and Employee Relations 

At December 31, 2015 , we have approximately 10,500 employees in North America and 4,300 employees internationally. We believe that our current relations with employees are good. Management keeps employees informed of decisions and encourages and implements employee suggestions whenever practicable.
