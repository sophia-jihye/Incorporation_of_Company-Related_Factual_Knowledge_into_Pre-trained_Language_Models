 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Kimberly-Clark Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. We are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life through product innovation and building our personal care, consumer tissue and K-C Professional brands. We are principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of a wide range of products mostly made from natural or synthetic fibers using advanced technologies in fibers, nonwovens and absorbency. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "Corporation," "Kimberly-Clark," "K-C," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

For financial information by business segment and geographic area, including revenue, profit and total assets of each reportable segment, and information about our principal products and markets, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&#38;A") and Item 8, Note 16 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted. 

Recent Developments 

Effective January 2015, we amended the U.S. pension plan to include a lump-sum pension benefit payout option for certain plan participants. In addition, in April 2015, the U.S. pension plan completed the purchase of group annuity contracts that transferred to two insurance companies the pension benefit obligations totaling $2.5 billion for approximately 21,000 &#32;Kimberly-Clark retirees in the United States. As a result of these changes, we recognized pension settlement-related charges of $0.8 billion &#32;after tax ( $1.4 billion &#32;pre-tax in other (income) and expense, net) during 2015 , mostly in the second quarter. See additional information in MD&#38;A and Item 8, Note 9 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Effective December 31, 2015, we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of our business in Venezuela from our consolidated balance sheet and moved to the cost method of accounting for our operations in that country. The change reflects the continued deterioration of conditions in the country, including a slowdown in the availability of foreign exchange, and resulted in an after tax charge of $102 &#32;in the fourth quarter of 2015 . Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan business in our consolidated financial statements. 

Description of Kimberly-Clark 

We are organized into operating segments based on product groupings. These operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable global business segments. Information on these three segments, as well as their principal sources of revenue, is included below. 

&#8226; 

Personal Care &#32;brands offer our consumers a trusted partner in caring for themselves and their families by delivering confidence, protection and discretion through a wide variety of innovative solutions and products such as disposable diapers, training and youth pants, swimpants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products, and other related products. Products in this segment are sold under the Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, DryNites, Kotex, U by Kotex, Intimus, Depend, Plenitud, Poise and other brand names. 

&#8226; 

Consumer Tissue &#32;offers a wide variety of innovative solutions and trusted brands that touch and improve people's lives every day. Products in this segment include facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products, and are sold under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Neve and other brand names. 

&#8226; 

K-C Professional &#32;partners with businesses to create Exceptional Workplaces, helping to make them healthier, safer and more productive through a range of solutions and supporting products such as wipers, tissue, towels, apparel, soaps and sanitizers. Our brands, including Kleenex, Scott, WypAll, Kimtech and Jackson Safety, are well-known for quality and trusted to help people around the world work better. 

These reportable segments were determined in accordance with how our chief operating decision maker and our executive managers develop and execute our global strategies to drive growth and profitability of our worldwide personal care, consumer tissue and KCP operations. These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses. 

Products for household use are sold directly to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, drugstores, warehouse clubs, variety and department stores and other retail outlets, as well as through other distributors and e-commerce. Products for away-from-home

Net sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were approximately 14 percent &#32;in 2015 , and approximately 13 percent &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , of our total net sales. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We own various patents and trademarks registered domestically and in many foreign countries. We consider the patents and trademarks that we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products to be material to our business. Consequently, we seek patent and trademark protection by all available means, including registration. 

Raw Materials 

Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered waste paper, is the primary raw material for our tissue products and in the form of fluff pulp is a component of disposable diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads and incontinence care products. 

Polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics, which are used in disposable diapers, training and youth pants, wet wipes, feminine pads, incontinence products, and away-from-home wipers and apparel. Superabsorbent materials are important components of disposable diapers, training and youth pants and incontinence care products. 

Raw materials are purchased from third parties, and we consider the supply to be adequate to meet the needs of our businesses. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 

Competition 

We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified than us. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities. For additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenditures are directed toward new or improved personal care, tissue, wiping, safety and nonwoven materials. Consolidated research and development expense was $324 &#32;in 2015 , $368 &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $333 &#32;in 2013 . 

Foreign Market Risks 

We operate and market our products globally, and our business strategy includes targeted growth in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with a particular emphasis in China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of foreign market risks that may affect our financial results.
