 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Jack Henry &#38; Associates, Inc. was founded in 1976 as a provider of core information processing solutions for community banks. Today, the Company&#8217;s extensive array of products and services includes processing transactions, automating business processes, and managing information for over &#32; 10,500 &#32;financial institutions and diverse corporate entities. 

JHA provides its products and services through three business brands: 

&#8226; 

Jack Henry Banking &#32;is a leading provider of integrated data processing systems to over &#32; 1,100 &#32;banks ranging from community banks to multi-billion dollar institutions with assets of up to $30 billion . Our banking solutions support both in-house and outsourced operating environments with three functionally distinct core processing platforms and more than &#32; 100 &#32;integrated complementary solutions. 

&#8226; 

Symitar &#32;is a leading provider of core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, with over &#32; 800 &#32;credit union customers. Symitar markets two functionally distinct core processing platforms and more than &#32; 50 &#32;integrated complementary solutions that support both in-house and outsourced operating environments. 

&#8226; 

ProfitStars &#32;is a leading provider of highly specialized products and services to financial institutions that are primarily not core customers of the Company. ProfitStars offers highly specialized financial performance, imaging and payments processing, information security and risk management, retail delivery, and online and mobile solutions. ProfitStars&#8217; products and services enhance the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and diverse corporate entities with nearly &#32; 10,200 &#32;domestic and international customers. 

Our products and services enable our customers to implement technology solutions that can be tailored to support their unique growth, service, operational, and performance goals. Our solutions also enable financial institutions to offer the high-demand products and services required to compete more successfully, and to capitalize on evolving trends shaping the financial services industry. 

We are committed to exceeding our customers&#8217; service-related expectations. We measure and monitor customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and online surveys initiated each day randomly by routine support requests. The results of this extensive survey process confirm that our service consistently exceeds our customers&#8217; expectations and generates excellent customer retention rates. 

We also focus on establishing long-term customer relationships, continually expanding and strengthening those relationships with cross sales of additional products and services, earning new traditional and nontraditional clients, and ensuring each product offering is highly competitive. 

The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring electronic payment services and outsourcing services that both generally have contract terms of five years or greater, and support and service fees. Less predictable software license fees, paid by customers implementing our software solutions in-house, and hardware sales, including all non-software products that we re-market in order to support our software systems, complement our primary revenue sources. 

JHA ended fiscal 2016 &#32;with $1,354.6 million &#32;in revenue. This has increased from $946.4 million &#32;at the end of fiscal 2011 , representing a compound annual growth rate during this five-year period of 7% . &#32;Net income from continuing operations has grown from $128.4 million &#32;to $248.9 million &#32;during this same five-year period, representing a compound annual growth rate of 14% . &#32;Information regarding the classification of our business into separate segments serving the banking and credit union industries is set forth in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Item 8). 

JHA&#8217;s progress and performance have been guided by the focused work ethic and fundamental ideals fostered by the Company&#8217;s founders 40 years ago: 

&#8226; 

Do the right thing, 

&#8226; 

Do whatever it takes, and 

&#8226; 

Have fun. 

We recognize that our associates and their collective contribution are ultimately responsible for JHA&#8217;s past, present, and future success. Recruiting and retaining high-quality employees is essential to our ongoing growth and financial performance, and we have established a corporate culture that sustains high levels of employee satisfaction. 

Industry Background 

Jack Henry Banking primarily serves commercial banks and savings institutions with up to $30 billion &#32;in assets. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), there were more than 6,100 &#32;commercial banks and savings institutions in this asset range as of December 31, 2015 . Jack Henry Banking currently supports over &#32; 1,100 &#32;of these banks with its core information processing platforms and complementary products and services. 

Symitar serves credit unions of all asset sizes. According to the Credit Union National Association (&#8220;CUNA&#8221;), there were nearly 6,300 &#32;domestic credit unions as of December 31, 2015 . Symitar currently supports over &#32; 800 &#32;of these credit unions with core information processing platforms and complementary products and services. 

ProfitStars serves financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters and other diverse corporate entities. ProfitStars currently supports nearly &#32; 10,200 &#32;institutions with specialized solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security, mitigating operational risks, and controlling operating costs. 

The FDIC reports the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined 19% &#32;from the beginning of calendar year 2011 &#32;to the end of calendar year 2015 . Although the number of banks declined at a 4% &#32;compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 4% &#32;and totaled $14.9 trillion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . There was one &#32;new bank charter issued in calendar year 2015 , compared to none &#32;in calendar 2014 . Comparing calendar years 2015 &#32;to 2014 , mergers increased 11% .

Community and mid-tier banks and credit unions are important in the communities and to the consumers they serve. Bank customers and credit union members rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the customer&#8217;s delivery channel of choice. Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining customers/members in today&#8217;s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near and long term performance goals are often technology-dependent. Financial institutions must implement technological solutions that enable them to: 

&#8226; 

Maximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information; 

&#8226; 

Offer the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional competitors and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry; 

&#8226; 

Enhance the customer/member experience at varied points of contact; 

&#8226; 

Expand existing customer/member relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services; 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on new revenue and deposit growth opportunities; 

&#8226; 

Increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs; 

&#8226; 

Implement e-commerce, mobile, and digital strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today&#8217;s financial services industry; 

&#8226; 

Protect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure; 

&#8226; 

Protect customers/members with various security tools from fraud and related financial losses; 

&#8226; 

Maximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments; and 

&#8226; 

Ensure full regulatory compliance. 

JHA&#8217;s extensive product and service offering enables diverse financial institutions to capitalize on these business opportunities and respond to these business challenges. We strive to establish a long-term, value-added technology partnership with each customer, and to continually expand our offering with the specific solutions our customers need to prosper in the evolving financial services industry. 

Mission Statement 

JHA&#8217;s mission is to protect and increase the value of its stockholders' investment by providing quality products and services to our customers. We perform this mission by: 

&#8226; 

Concentrating our activities on what we know best - information systems and services for financial institutions; 

&#8226; 

Providing outstanding commitment and service to our customers so that the perceived value of our products and services is consistent with the real value; and 

&#8226; 

Maintaining a work environment that is personally, professionally, and financially rewarding to our employees. 

Business Strategy 

Our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions. We execute this strategy by: 

&#8226; 

Providing commercial banks and credit unions with core software systems that provide excellent functionality, and support in-house and outsourced operating environments with identical functionality. 

&#8226; 

Expanding each core customer relationship by cross-selling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems. 

&#8226; 

Maintaining a company-wide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers&#8217; expectations and generates high levels of customer retention. 

&#8226; 

Capitalizing on our acquisition strategy. 

Acquisition Strategy 

We have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions, including 29 acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999. We continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to: 

&#8226; 

Expand our suite of complementary products and services; 

&#8226; 

Provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and non-core customers and outside our base to new customers; and /or 

&#8226; 

Provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry. 

We have completed two acquisitions in the last 3 years. After 40 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line, so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues. In addition, we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions. 

We have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction, complement and accelerate our organic growth, and generate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Until we identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, we will continue to find alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders, such as repurchases of our stock and continued payment of dividends. 

Our five most recent acquisitions were:

Solutions

&#8226;

We have three functionally distinct core bank processing systems and more than &#32; 100 &#32;complementary solutions, including business intelligence and bank management, retail and business banking, internet banking and electronic payment services, risk management and protection, and item and document imaging solutions. Our banking solutions have state-of-the-art functional capabilities, and we can re-market the hardware required by each software system.

Jack Henry Banking is a recognized market leader, currently supporting over &#32; 1,100 &#32;banks with its technology platforms. 

&#8226;

Its solutions include two functionally distinct core processing systems and more than &#32; 50 &#32;complementary solutions, including business intelligence and credit union management, member and member business services, internet banking and electronic payment services, risk management and protection, and item and document imaging solutions. Our credit union solutions also have state-of-the-art functional capabilities, and we can re-market the hardware required by each software system. Our credit union solutions can be delivered in-house or through outsourced delivery model, and are also backed by our company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service. Symitar currently supports over &#32; 800 &#32;credit union customers. 

&#8226; 

ProfitStars &#32;is a leading provider of specialized products and services assembled through our focused diversification acquisition strategy. These solutions are compatible with a wide variety of information technology platforms and 

operating environments, and include proven solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security and mitigating operational risks, and/or controlling operating costs. ProfitStars&#8217; products and services enhance the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and diverse corporate entities with nearly &#32; 10,200 &#32;domestic and international customers. These distinct products and services can be implemented individually or as solution suites to address specific business problems or needs and enable effective responses to dynamic industry trends. 

We will continue to develop and maintain functionally robust, integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels; regularly enhancing those solutions using an interactive customer enhancement process; compliant with relevant regulations; updated with proven advances in technology; and consistent with JHA&#8217;s reputation as a premium product and service provider. 

Core Software Systems 

Core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and to maintain centralized customer/member information. 

Jack Henry Banking markets three core software systems to banks and Symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions. These core systems are available for in-house installation at customer sites, or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to JHA. 

Jack Henry Banking&#8217;s three core banking platforms are: 

&#8226; 

SilverLake&#174;, a robust IBM Power System&#8482; (i/OS) based system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks with assets ranging from $500 million to $30 billion. However, some progressive smaller banks and start-up banks also select SilverLake. This system has been implemented by over &#32; 400 &#32;banks, and now automates approximately &#32; 6.5% &#32;of the domestic banks with assets less than $30 billion. 

&#8226; 

CIF 20/20&#174;, a parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports over &#32; 530 &#32;banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $2 billion. CIF 20/20 is the most widely used IBM Power System&#8482; (i/OS) core processing system in the community bank market. 

&#8226; 

Core Director&#174;, a Windows&#174;-based, client/server system that now supports nearly &#32; 200 &#32;banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $1 billion. Core Director is a cost-efficient operating platform and provides intuitive point-and-click operation. 

Symitar&#8217;s two core credit union platforms are: 

&#8226; 

Episys&#174;, &#32;a robust IBM Power System&#8482; (AIX&#174;) based system primarily designed for credit unions with more than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by over &#32; 640 &#32;credit unions and is ranked as the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other alternative system. 

&#8226; 

CruiseNet&#174;, &#32;a Windows-based, client/server system designed primarily for credit unions with less than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by more than &#32; 160 &#32;credit unions, is cost-efficient, and provides intuitive point-and-click, drag-and-drop operation. 

Customers electing to install our solutions in-house license the proprietary software systems based on initial license fees. The large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We also re-market the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions; and we contract to perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. In-house customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location. 

Customers can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by in-house installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to JHA. Our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four &#32;data centers located in three &#32;physical locations. We also provide image item processing services from two &#32;host/archive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country. We print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three &#32;regional printing and rendering centers. Customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five &#32;or more years that include transaction-based processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period. 

We support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system, the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products, the ongoing integration of practical new technologies, and regulatory compliance initiatives. JHA also serves each core customer as a single point of contact, support, and accountability. 

Complementary Products and Services 

We provide more than &#32; 100 &#32;complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers, and selectively sold by our ProfitStars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems. 

These complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customer/member demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase operating efficiency, address specific operational issues, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions sold by ProfitStars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security and mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs. 

JHA regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients, and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and containing costs. The Company&#8217;s Industry Research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need, evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, and manages the introduction of new product offerings. JHA&#8217;s new complementary products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances. 

Electronic Payment Services 

Electronic payment services supports our customers with convenient and secure payment processing designed to help them simplify complex payment processing, attract profitable retail and commercial accounts, increase operating efficiencies, comply with regulatory mandates, and proactively mitigate and manage payments-related risk and fraud while staying at the forefront of payments innovation. 

Jack Henry identifies three components of Electronic Payment Services: 

&#8226; 

Card Services provides a comprehensive suite of Automated Teller Machine ("ATM"), debit, and credit card transaction processing and management solutions. Our card processing solutions, which include awards, fraud detection, ability to hot card and initiate new replacement cards, and ATM management products, are fully integrated with JHA's core and complementary solutions, facilitating seamless transaction processing. 

&#8226; 

Bill Pay and Mobile banking platforms are offered through our iPay and Banno product offerings. iPay offers iPay Business Bill Pay&#8482;, a full suite of online financial management solutions designed to meet the distinct needs of small businesses, as well as iPay Consumer Bill Pay&#8482;, a solution that supports single or recurring payments, allows customers to receive bills electronically, and easily integrates with any internet banking provider. Banno Mobile&#8482; offers a native mobile banking application for both iOS and Android that offers innovative and cost-effective mobile services that can be marketed with customer's own brand identity. It allows customers to aggregate all of their account balances and transactional data from multiple financial institutions and empowers them with the convenience of anytime, anywhere account access. 

&#8226; 

Processing/ Other- Enterprise Payment Solutions (EPS), is a comprehensive payments engine and the leading total payments solution on the market today. EPS offers an integrated suite of remote deposit capture, ACH and card transaction processing solutions, risk management tools, reporting capabilities, and more for financial institutions of all sizes. EPS helps financial institutions succeed in today&#8217;s competitive market to increase revenue, improve efficiencies, better manage compliance, and enhance customer relationships. Commercial Lending Solutions help FIs securely transition from a traditional lending portfolio (focused on real estate-based consumer lending) to a more fully-diversified portfolio developed via commercial and industrial lending. Our solutions also provide reliable ways to retain creditworthy business customers facing financial hurdles, without the risk of loan loss. 

Hardware Systems 

Our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation (fulfilled directly and through IBM distributors), Avnet, Inc., and other hardware providers that allow JHA to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers. We currently sell the IBM Power Systems; Lenovo servers and workstations; Dell servers and workstations; Burroughs, RDM, Panini, Digital Check, Canon check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions. 

Implementation and Training 

The majority of our new core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems. 

A complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the JHA system. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed. 

We also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers. Know-It-All Education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education. The curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of JHA&#8217;s core and complementary products, to optimize ongoing system enhancements, and to fully understand dynamic year-end legislative and regulatory requirements. Each basic, intermediate, and advanced course is delivered by system experts, supported by professional materials and training tools, and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach. Know-It-All Education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels, including classroom-based courses offered in JHA&#8217;s regional training centers, Internet-based live instruction, eLearning courses, on-site training, and train-the-trainer programs. 

Support and Services 

We serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide. The Company&#8217;s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates: 

&#8226; 

Exacting service standards; 

&#8226; 

Trained support staff available 24 hours-a-day, 365 days-a-year; 

&#8226; 

Assigned account managers; 

&#8226; 

Sophisticated support tools, resources, and technology; 

&#8226; 

Broad experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from every competitive platform; 

&#8226; 

Highly effective change management and control processes; and 

&#8226; 

A best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience supporting over &#32; 10,500 &#32;diverse clients. 

Most in-house customers contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for JHA. These support services are typically priced at approximately 18% to 20% of the respective product&#8217;s software license fee. These fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees are typically billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with pro-ration for new product implementations that occur during the year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or JHA gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration. 

High levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for in-house customers. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees. 

JHA regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests. This process shows that we consistently exceed our customers&#8217; service-related expectations. 

Backlog 

Backlog consists of contracted in-house products and services that have not been delivered. Backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multi-year outsourcing contracts, and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period. 

Backlog as of June 30, 2016 &#32;totaled $620.6 million , consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software, hardware, and implementation services (in-house backlog) of approximately $95.6 million , and $525.0 million for outsourcing services. Approximately $406.0 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of June 30, 2016 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2017 due to the long-term nature of our outsourcing contracts. Backlog as of June 30, 2015 totaled $527.8 million , consisting of $96.3 million for future delivery of in-house software, hardware, and implementation services (in-house backlog), and $431.5 million for outsourcing services. 

The in-house backlog does not include amounts related to items that have been delivered but cannot be recognized as revenue due to accounting rules for software revenue recognition; those amounts are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet to the extent that they have been billed to the customer as of June 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 . 

Our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multi-year contracts, and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2017 , the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities. 

Research and Development 

We invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services, and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance. Our core and the majority of our complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely customer-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing customer contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers, and reduce related costs. 

Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 &#32;were $81.2 million , $71.5 million , and $66.7 million , respectively. Capitalized software for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 &#32;was $96.4 million , $76.9 million , and $62.2 million , respectively. 

Sales and Marketing 

JHA serves established, well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sales opportunities. 

Jack Henry Banking sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions primarily to domestic commercial banks with assets up to $30 billion . Symitar sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions primarily to domestic credit unions of all asset sizes. The marketing and sales initiatives within these business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. ProfitStars sells specialized niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters. 

Dedicated sales forces support each of JHA&#8217;s three business brands. Sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Brand-specific sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. Our marketing department supports all three business lines with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; telemarketing; customer newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. JHA also hosts annual national user group meetings which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services. 

JHA has sold select products and services in the Caribbean, Europe, Canada, and South America. International sales account for approximately &#32; 1% &#32;of JHA&#8217;s total revenue in each of the three years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 . 

Competition 

The market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of JHA&#8217;s current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility and ease-of-use, customer support, and existing customer references. For more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions, and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future. 

Jack Henry Banking and Symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.; Fiserv, Inc.; and DH Corporation. ProfitStars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities. 

Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks 

Although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights, our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology. We have registered or filed applications 

for our primary trademarks. Most of our technology is not patented. Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, resellers, customers, and potential customers. Access to and distribution of our Company&#8217;s source code is restricted, and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain, or use our products or technology. We cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. 

Regulatory Compliance 

JHA maintains a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by the federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given. JHA&#8217;s compliance program is provided by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience, and a thorough working knowledge of JHA and our solutions. These compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements, including regular discussions on emerging topics with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;) examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations. 

JHA has a process to inform internal departments of new and revised regulatory requirements. Upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the Company&#8217;s product-specific change control boards and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle. A representative of JHA&#8217;s compliance organization serves on every change control board to ensure that the regulatory perspective is addressed in proposed product/service changes. We publish newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations. Periodically, customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes. 

Internal audits of our systems, networks, operations, business recovery plans, and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems, processes, plans and security. Ensuring that confidential information remains private is a high priority, and JHA&#8217;s initiatives to protect confidential information include regular third-party application reviews intended to better secure information access. Additional third-party reviews are performed throughout the organization, such as vulnerability tests, intrusion tests, and Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements ("SSAE") 16 reviews. The FFIEC conducts annual reviews throughout the Company and issues reports that are reviewed by the JHA Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Government Regulation 

The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. All financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision. Our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers, including but not limited to those mandated by federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information regulations, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The compliance of JHA&#8217;s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors, including the particular functionality, the interactive design, the classification of customers, and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services. Our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is still evolving as the regulations are written to implement the various provisions of the law. We cannot predict the impact these regulations, any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future. 

JHA is not chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions. However, operating as a service provider to financial institutions, JHA&#8217;s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions, and subject to periodic reviews by FFIEC regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews. 

JHA provides outsourced services through OutLink &#8482; &#32;Data Centers, electronic transaction processing through Card Processing Solutions, Internet banking through NetTeller, MemberConnect &#8482;, &#32;and Banno online solutions, bill payment through iPay, network security monitoring through our Gladiator unit, Cloud Services and business recovery services through Centurion Disaster Recovery. 

The outsourcing services provided by JHA are subject to examination by FFIEC regulators under the Bank Service Company Act. These examinations cover a wide variety of subjects, including system development, functionality, reliability, and security, as well as disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. Our outsourcing services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities on occasion.
