In addition, the Company joined the OpenHPC community to enable customers to reduce risk and to save time with specifying, deploying and managing HPC systems. In 2015, ANSYS and Cray, working in conjunction with the supercomputing centers NCSA and NERSC, established a new simulation world record by scaling ANSYS Fluent &#174; &#32;to 129,000 compute cores. 

In the area of cloud computing, the Company has tightened its partnership with Amazon Web Services by providing enterprise customers a reference architecture for end-to-end simulation that can be globally deployed in a virtual private cloud on demand within days. Due to the Company's participation in the AWS Partner Network, the Company was able to work with other partners who had extensive expertise running workloads in the Cloud, such as Cycle Computing and NICE Software, to develop the new ANSYS Enterprise Cloud solution. In addition, the Company strengthened its cloud-hosting service partnerships with Atos, CPU 24/7, Gompute, Nimbix, R Systems and Penguin Computing by further improving best practices for executing engineering simulation in the Cloud. 

The Company's Enhanced Solution Partner Program actively encourages specialized developers of software solutions to use the Company's technology as a development platform for their applications and provides customers with enhanced functionality related to their use of the Company's software. With over 100 active enhanced solution partnerships, spanning a wide range of technologies, including optimization, electronics, mechanical simulation, fluid simulation and CAD, this partner ecosystem extends the depth and breadth of the Company's technology offerings. 

The Company has a software license agreement with Livermore Software Technology Corporation ("LSTC") whereby LSTC has provided LS-DYNA software for explicit dynamics solutions used in applications such as crash test simulations in automotive and other industries. Under this arrangement, LSTC assists in the integration of the LS-DYNA software with the 

Company's pre- and post-processing capabilities and provides updates and problem resolution in return for royalties from sales of the ANSYS/LS-DYNA combined product. 

The Company has a software license agreement with HBM that provides the advanced fatigue capabilities of nCode DesignLife&#8482;, a leading durability software from HBM. ANSYS nCode DesignLife&#8482; technology leverages the open architecture of the ANSYS platform and enables mechanical engineers to more easily address complex product life and durability issues before a prototype is built. 

The Company has a software license agreement with NICE that targets the emerging paradigm of data-center-based deployment of simulation. EngineFrame from NICE is bundled with ANSYS EKM and facilitates running interactive ANSYS applications on remote data centers. 

COMPETITION 

The Company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and total cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability, and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. 

The Company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services. Some of the Company's current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well-established relationships with current and potential customers of the Company. The Company's current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income. 

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES 

The Company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses, which are typically nontransferable, for the use of the Company's products. License agreements for the Company's products are directly between the Company and end users. Use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multi-site license for its use of the software product. Software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the Company's software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction. Customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and upgrades, or may lease the product on a fixed-term basis for a fee that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades. 

The Company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of web-based and hard-copy license terms and forms. For certain software products, the Company primarily relies on "click-wrapped" licenses. The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain. 

The Company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work. The Company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ANSYS and other marks in the U.S. and foreign countries. Additionally, the Company was awarded numerous patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and has a number of patent applications pending. To the extent the Company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property, the Company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret. 

Employees of the Company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information. These agreements, where legally permitted, restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the Company anywhere in the world while employed by the Company (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter) and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are the property of the Company. In addition, the Company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the Company's trade secrets and other proprietary information. 

Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the Company's technology and proprietary information (including source code) will be prevented. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for the Company's products in certain jurisdictions, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the Company will be enforceable. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the Company's rights to its trade secrets and proprietary 

information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights, and it is possible that, in the future, the Company's competitors may be able to obtain the Company's trade secrets or to independently develop similar, unpatented technology. 

The software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, the Company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available. 

The Company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by the Company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. The Company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product release delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company. 

SEASONAL VARIATIONS 

The Company's business has experienced seasonality, including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months, particularly in Europe, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the Company's global customers. The Company's revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter. 

DEFERRED REVENUE AND BACKLOG 

Deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from software license and maintenance agreements. The deferred revenue on the Company's consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable software license and maintenance agreements. The Company's backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and custom er orders received but not processed. The Company's deferred revenue and backlog as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;consisted of the following:
