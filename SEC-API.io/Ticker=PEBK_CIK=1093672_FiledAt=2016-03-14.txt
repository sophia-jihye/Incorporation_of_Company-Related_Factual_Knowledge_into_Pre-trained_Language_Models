 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

General

Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina, Inc. (the "Company"), was formed in 1999 to serve as the holding company for Peoples Bank (the "Bank"). The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). The Company's principal source of income is dividends declared and paid by the Bank on its capital stock, if any. The Company has no operations and conducts no business of its own other than owning the Bank and Community Bank Real Estate Solutions, LLC ("CBRES"). Accordingly, the discussion of the business which follows concerns the business conducted by the Bank, unless otherwise indicated.

The Bank, founded in 1912, is a state-chartered commercial bank serving the citizens and business interests of the Catawba Valley and surrounding communities through 20 banking offices, as of December 31, 2015 located in Lincolnton, Newton, Denver, Catawba, Conover, Maiden, Claremont, Hiddenite, Hickory, Charlotte, Monroe, Cornelius, Mooresville and Raleigh, North Carolina. The Bank also operates loan production offices in Denver, Durham and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At December 31, 2015, the Company had total assets of $1.0 billion, net loans of $679.5 million, deposits of $832.2 million, total securities of $272.2 million, and shareholders' equity of $104.9 million.

The Bank operates four banking offices focused on the Latino population under the name Banco de la Gente ("Banco"). These offices are operated as a division of the Bank. Banco offers normal and customary banking services as are offered in the Bank's other branches such as the taking of deposits and the making of loans and therefore is not considered a reportable segment of the Company. The Bank operates one Banco loan production office in Durham County and one Banco loan production office in Forsyth County specifically designed to serve the growing Latino market.

The Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, with no foreign loans and few agricultural loans. Real estate loans are predominately variable rate and fixed rate commercial property loans, which include residential development loans to commercial customers. Commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries with no one particular industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio. The majority of the Bank's deposit and loan customers are individuals and small to medium-sized businesses located in the Bank's market area. The Bank's loan portfolio also includes Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) mortgage loans generated thorough the Bank's Banco offices. Additional discussion of the Bank's loan portfolio and sources of funds for loans can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on pages A-4 through A-23 of the Annual Report, which is included in this Form 10-K as Exhibit (13).

The operations of the Bank and depository institutions in general are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of depository institution regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (the "Commissioner").

The Company's fiscal year ends December 31. This Form 10-K is also being used as the Bank's Annual Disclosure Statement under FDIC Regulations. This Form 10-K has not been reviewed, or confirmed for accuracy or relevance by the FDIC.

At December 31, 2015, the Company employed 284 full-time employees and 40 part-time employees, which equated to 309 full-time equivalent employees.

Subsidiaries

The Bank is a subsidiary of the Company. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had three subsidiaries, Peoples Investment Services, Inc., Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc. and PB Real Estate Holdings, LLC. Through a relationship with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Peoples Investment Services, Inc. provides the Bank's customers access to investment counseling and non-deposit investment products such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, tax deferred annuities, and related brokerage services. Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc. provides real estate appraisal and real estate brokerage services. PB Real Estate Holdings, LLC acquires, manages and disposes of real property, other collateral and other assets obtained in the ordinary course of collecting debts previously contracted.

&#160;

&#160;

In June 2006, the Company formed a wholly owned Delaware statutory trust, PEBK Capital Trust II ("PEBK Trust II"), which issued $20.0 million of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the Company's junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. All of the common securities of PEBK Trust II are owned by the Company. The proceeds from the issuance of the common securities and the trust preferred securities were used by PEBK Trust II to purchase $20.6 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company, which pay a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 163 basis points. The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the junior subordinated debentures were used in December 2006 to repay the trust preferred securities issued in December 2001 by PEBK Capital Trust, a wholly owned Delaware statutory trust of the Company, and for general purposes. The debentures represent the sole asset of PEBK Trust II. PEBK Trust II is not included in the consolidated financial statements.

The trust preferred securities issued by PEBK Trust II accrue and pay quarterly at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 163 basis points. The Company has guaranteed distributions and other payments due on the trust preferred securities to the extent PEBK Trust II does not have funds with which to make the distributions and other payments. The net combined effect of the trust preferred securities transaction is that the Company is obligated to make the distributions and other payments required on the trust preferred securities.

These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures on June 28, 2036, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. The Company has the right to redeem the debentures purchased by PEBK Trust II, in whole or in part, which became effective on June 28, 2011. As specified in the indenture, if the debentures are redeemed prior to maturity, the redemption price will be the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest.

The Company established CBRES, a wholly owned subsidiary, in 2009. CBRES serves as a "clearing-house" for appraisal services for community banks. Other banks are able to contract with CBRES to find and engage appropriate appraisal companies in the area where the property is located. This type of service ensures that the appraisal process remains independent from the financing process within the Bank.

Market Area

The Bank's primary market consists of the communities in an approximate 50-mile radius around its headquarters office in Newton, North Carolina. This area includes Catawba County, Alexander County, Lincoln County, Iredell County and portions of northeast Gaston County. The Bank is located only 40 miles north of Charlotte, North Carolina and the Bank's primary market area is and will continue to be significantly affected by its close proximity to this major metropolitan area. The Bank has two Banco offices in Mecklenburg County, one Banco office in Union County, one Banco office in Wake County, one Banco loan production office in Durham County and one Banco loan production office in Forsyth County specifically designed to serve the growing Latino market.

Employment in the Bank's primary market area is diversified among manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, technology, services and utilities. Catawba County's largest employers include Catawba County Schools, Frye Regional Medical Center, Catawba Valley Medical Center, Merchant Distributors, Inc. (wholesale food distributor), Catawba County, CommScope, Inc. (manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories), Corning Optical Communications (manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories), Ethan Allen (furniture manufacturer), HSM (manufacturing) and Advance Pierre Foods (restaurants and bakeries).

Competition

The Bank has operated in the Catawba Valley region for over 100 years and is the only financial institution headquartered in Newton. Nevertheless, the Bank faces strong competition both in attracting deposits and making loans. Its most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other commercial banks, credit unions and brokerage firms located in its primary market area, including large financial institutions. One national money center commercial bank is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Based upon June 30, 2015 comparative data, the Bank had 23.97% of the deposits in Catawba County, placing it second in deposit size among a total of 12 banks with branch offices in Catawba County; 9.69% of the deposits in Lincoln County, placing it fifth in deposit size among a total of 10 banks with branch offices in Lincoln County; and 13.35% of the deposits in Alexander County, placing it fifth in deposit size among a total of six banks with branch offices in Alexander County.

&#160;

&#160;

The Bank also faces additional significant competition for investors' funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. The Bank's core deposit base has grown principally due to economic growth in the Bank's market area coupled with the implementation of new and competitive deposit products. The ability of the Bank to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to generally provide a rate of return, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities.

The Bank experiences strong competition for loans from commercial banks and mortgage banking companies. The Bank competes for loans primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services it provides to borrowers. Competition is increasing as a result of the continuing reduction of restrictions on the interstate operations of financial institutions.

Supervision and Regulation

Bank holding companies and commercial banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or will affect the Company, the Bank and any subsidiaries. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute and regulatory provisions referred to below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the business of the Company, the Bank and any subsidiaries. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and the Bank by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders of the Company. Statutes and regulations which contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationship of financial institutions are introduced regularly. The Company cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and the Bank may be affected by such statute or regulation.

General . &#160; There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or in default. For example, to mitigate the risk of failure, bank holding companies are required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become "undercapitalized" with the terms of the capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the bank's total assets at the time the bank became undercapitalized or (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the bank into compliance with all capital standards as of the time the bank fails to comply with such capital restoration plan. The Company, as a registered bank holding company, is subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve. Under a policy of the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. The Federal Reserve under the BHCA also has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

In addition, insured depository institutions under common control are required to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered by its deposit insurance funds as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross&#8209;guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the deposit insurance funds. The FDIC's claim for damages is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.

As a result of the Company's ownership of the Bank, the Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of North Carolina. Accordingly, the Company is also subject to regulation and supervision by the Commissioner.

&#160;

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). &#160; The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed bank regulation and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.

The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.

The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC assessments for deposit insurance and permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor. The legislation also, among other things, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a portion of the credit risk, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the ability of shareholders to influence boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called "golden parachute" payments. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates or require the implementing regulations and, therefore, their impact on our operations cannot be fully determined at this time. However, it is likely that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Bank and the Company.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy . At December 31, 2015, the Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 11.03%, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.85%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.85% and total risk-based capital ratio of 16.11%. At December 31, 2015, the Company also exceeded each of its capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 11.44%, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.79%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.37% and total risk-based capital ratio of 16.63%.

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule that establishes an integrated regulatory capital framework that addresses shortcomings in certain capital requirements. The rule, which became effective on January 1, 2015, implements in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule:

&#183;

established a new minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets) of 4.5% and increased the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%, while maintaining the minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% and the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.0%;

&#183;

revised the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity;

&#183;

phased out trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock as Tier 1 capital;

&#183;

added a requirement to maintain a minimum conservation buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, to be applied to the new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the Total risk-based capital ratio, which means that banking organizations, on a fully phased in basis no later than January 1, 2019, must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5% and a minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%; and

&#183;

changed the definitions of capital categories for insured depository institutions for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 prompt corrective action provisions. Under these revised definitions, to be considered well-capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%.

The new minimum regulatory capital ratios and changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015. The required minimum conservation buffer began to be phased in incrementally, starting at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and will increase to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

&#160;

&#160;

The final rule established common equity Tier 1 capital as a new capital component. Common equity Tier 1 capital consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the final rule, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and common equity Tier 1 minority interest. As a result, Tier 1 capital has two components: common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The final rule also revised the eligibility criteria for inclusion in additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. As a result of these changes, certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities, are excluded as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of our size.

The final rule further require that certain items be deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital, including (1) goodwill and other intangible assets, other than mortgage servicing rights, net of deferred tax liabilities ("DTLs"); (2) deferred tax assets that arise from operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, net of valuation allowances and DTLs; (3) after-tax gain-on-sale associated with a securitization exposure; and (4) defined benefit pension fund assets held by a depository institution holding company, net of DTLs. In addition, banking organizations must deduct from common equity Tier 1 capital the amount of certain assets, including mortgage servicing assets, that exceed certain thresholds. The final rule also allows all but the largest banking organizations to make a one-time election not to recognize unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities in regulatory capital, as under prior capital rules.

The final rule provides that the failure to maintain the minimum conservation buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. If a banking organization's conservation buffer is less than 0.625%, the banking organization may not make any capital distributions or discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. If the conservation buffer is greater than 0.625% but not greater than 1.25%, capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments are limited to 20% of net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the applicable calendar quarter (net of any such capital distributions), or eligible retained income. If the conservation buffer is greater than 1.25% but not greater than 1.875%, the limit is 40% of eligible retained income, and if the conservation buffer is greater than 1.875% but not greater than 2.5%, the limit is 60% of eligible retained income. The preceding thresholds for the conservation buffer and related restrictions represent the fully phased in rules effective no later than January 1, 2019. Such thresholds will be phased in incrementally throughout the phase in period, with the lowest thresholds having become effective January 1, 2016.

&#160;

Dividend and Repurchase Limitations . &#160; Federal regulations provide that the Company must obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to repurchasing its common stock for consideration in excess of 10% of its net worth during any twelve-month period unless the Company (i) both before and after the redemption satisfies capital requirements for a "well capitalized" bank holding company; (ii) received a one or two rating in its last examination; and (iii) is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.

The ability of the Company to pay dividends or repurchase shares may be dependent upon the Company's receipt of dividends from the Bank. North Carolina commercial banks, such as the bank, are subject to legal limitations on the amounts of dividends they are permitted to pay. Also, an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become "undercapitalized" (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations).

Deposit Insurance . The assessment paid by each Deposit Insurance Fund member institution is based on its relative risks of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors. Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution's capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category. An institution's capitalization risk category is based on the FDIC's determination of whether the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized.

An institution's supervisory subgroup category is based on the FDIC's assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that FDIC intervention or other corrective action will be required. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

The Dodd-Frank Act expands the base for FDIC insurance assessments, requiring that assessments be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement the foregoing provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the final rule revises the assessment rate schedule to provide assessments ranging from 5 to 35 basis points, with the initial assessment rates subject to adjustments which could increase or decrease the total base assessment rates. The FDIC has three possible adjustments to an institution's initial base assessment rate: (i) a decrease of up to five basis points (or 50% of the initial base assessment rate) for long-term unsecured debt, including senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt; (ii) an increase for holding long-term unsecured or subordinated debt issued by other insured depository institutions known as the Depository Institution Debt Adjustment and (iii) for institutions not well rated and well capitalized, an increase not to exceed 10 basis points for brokered deposits in excess of 10 percent of domestic deposits.

Federal Home Loan Bank System . &#160; The Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") system provides a central credit facility for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta in an amount at least equal to 0.20% (or 20 basis points) of the Bank's total assets at the end of each calendar year, plus 4.5% of its outstanding advances (borrowings) from the FHLB of Atlanta under the new activity-based stock ownership requirement. On December 31, 2015, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.

Community Reinvestment. &#160; Under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), as implemented by regulations of the FDIC, an insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop, consistent with the CRA, the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the federal banking regulators, in connection with their examinations of insured institutions, to assess the institutions' records of meeting the credit needs of their communities, using the ratings of "outstanding," "satisfactory," "needs to improve," or "substantial noncompliance," and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by those institutions. All institutions are required to make public disclosure of their CRA performance ratings. The Bank received a "satisfactory" rating in its last CRA examination, which was conducted during January 2014.

Changes in Control. &#160; The BHCA prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings bank or merging or consolidating with another bank or financial holding company or savings bank holding company without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Similarly, Federal Reserve approval (or, in certain cases, non&#8209;objection) must be obtained prior to any person acquiring control of the Company. Control is deemed to exist if, among other things, a person acquires 25% or more of any class of voting stock of the Company or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the Company. Control is presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and the stock is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time (the "Exchange Act"), or the acquiror will be the largest shareholder after the acquisition.

Federal Securities Law . &#160; The Company has registered its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result of such registration, the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements, annual and periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable to the Company.

Transactions with Affiliates. &#160; Under current federal law, depository institutions are subject to the restrictions contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act with respect to loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to directors, executive officers and shareholders who own more than 10% of a depository institution (18% in the case of institutions located in an area with less than 30,000 in population), and certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the institution's loans-to-one-borrower limit (as discussed below). Section 22(h) also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers and shareholders who own more than 10% of an institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution. Any "interested" director may not participate in the voting. The FDIC has prescribed the loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to such person), as to which such prior board of director approval is required, as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000). Further, pursuant to Section 22(h), the Federal Reserve requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions with non-executive employees of the Bank. The FDIC has imposed additional limits on the amount a bank can loan to an executive officer.

Loans to One Borrower. &#160; The Bank is subject to the loans-to-one-borrower limits imposed by North Carolina law, which are substantially the same as those applicable to national banks. Under these limits, no loans and extensions of credit to any borrower outstanding at one time and not fully secured by readily marketable collateral shall exceed 15% of the Bank's total equity capital. At December 31, 2015, this limit was $18.1 million. This limit is increased by an additional 10% of the Bank's total equity capital, or $30.1 million as of December 31, 2015, for loans and extensions of credit that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral.

&#160;

&#160;

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. &#160; The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLB Act") dramatically changed various federal laws governing the banking, securities and insurance industries. The GLB Act expanded opportunities for banks and bank holding companies to provide services and engage in other revenue-generating activities that previously were prohibited. In doing so, it increased competition in the financial services industry, presenting greater opportunities for our larger competitors, which were more able to expand their service and products than smaller, community-oriented financial institutions, such as the Bank.

USA Patriot Act of 2001 . The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the "Patriot Act") was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks that occurred in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001. The Patriot Act was intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions of all kinds has been significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations, including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.

Interstate Banking and Branching. &#160; The BHCA was amended by the Interstate Banking Act. The Interstate Banking Act provides that adequately capitalized and managed financial and bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks in any state. State law prohibiting interstate banking or discriminating against out-of-state banks is preempted. States are not permitted to enact laws opting out of this provision; however, states are allowed to adopt a minimum age restriction requiring that target banks located within the state be in existence for a period of years, up to a maximum of five years, before a bank may be subject to the Interstate Banking Act. The Interstate Banking Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, establishes deposit caps which prohibit acquisitions that result in the acquiring company controlling 30% or more of the deposits of insured banks and thrift institutions held in the state in which the target maintains a breach or 10% or more of the deposits nationwide. States have the authority to waive the 30% deposit cap. State-level deposit caps are not preempted as long as they do not discriminate against out-of-state companies, and the federal deposit caps apply only to initial entry acquisitions.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandates for public companies a variety of reforms intended to address corporate and accounting fraud and provides for the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") which enforces auditing, quality control and independence standards for firms that audit SEC-reporting companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes higher standards for auditor independence and restricts the provision of consulting services by auditing firms to companies they audit and requires that certain audit partners be rotated periodically. It also requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalents, to certify the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the SEC, subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willfully violate this certification requirement, and increases the oversight and authority of audit committees of publicly traded companies.

Limits on Rates Paid on Deposits and Brokered Deposits . FDIC regulations limit the ability of insured depository institutions to accept, renew or roll-over deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other insured depository institutions having the same type of charter in such depository institution's normal market area. Under these regulations, "well capitalized" depository institutions may accept, renew or roll-over such deposits without restriction, "adequately capitalized" depository institutions may accept, renew or roll-over such deposits with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payments of rates) and "undercapitalized" depository institutions may not accept, renew, or roll-over such deposits. Definitions of "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized" and "undercapitalized" are the same as the definitions adopted by federal banking agencies to implement the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above.

Other. &#160; Additional regulations require annual examinations of all insured depository institutions by the appropriate federal banking agency and establish operational and managerial, asset quality, earnings and stock valuation standards for insured depository institutions, as well as compensation standards.

The Bank is subject to examination by the FDIC and the Commissioner. In addition, the Bank is subject to various other state and federal laws and regulations, including state usury laws, laws relating to fiduciaries, consumer credit, equal credit and fair credit reporting laws and laws relating to branch banking. The Bank, as an insured North Carolina commercial bank, is prohibited from engaging as a principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks, unless (i) the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund and (ii) the Bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.

&#160;

&#160;

Future Requirements . Statutes and regulations, which contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions, are introduced regularly. Neither the Company nor the Bank can predict whether or what form any proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company or the Bank may be affected by such statute or regulation.

&#160;

Consent Order

&#160;

On August 31, 2015, the FDIC and the Commissioner issued a Consent Order (the "Order") in connection with compliance by the Bank with the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations (collectively, the "BSA"). The Order was issued pursuant to the consent of the Bank. In consenting to the issuance of the Order, the Bank did not admit or deny any unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation.
